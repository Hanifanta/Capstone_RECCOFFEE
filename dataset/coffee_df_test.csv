Blind Assessment: Crisply sweet, cocoa-toned. Lemon blossom, roasted cacao nib, date, rice candy, white peppercorn in aroma and cup. Savory-tart structure; delicate, silky mouthfeel. The richly drying finish leads with cocoa-toned, crisply sweet floral notes in the short and a hint of spice (white peppercorn) in the long.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a tasting of 71 organic-certified coffees from Africa for Coffee Review’s November 2017 tasting report. Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are produced from traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. When processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying) they typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity with a particular emphasis on floral notes. Like virtually all southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. Revel Coffee is a micro-roaster located in Billings, Montana. Its motto: “Quality is paramount — a difference you can revel in.” Visit www.revelcoffee.com or call 406-534-9621 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Surprising and melodic, delicate yet vivid. Lilac and lemon blossom, fresh sweet grass, honey, moist pipe tobacco, fresh-cut elm in aroma and cup. In structure subtly and sweetly tart. Very light, silky mouthfeel. Unexpectedly rich and flavor-saturated in the finish: pipe tobacco, honey, lemon blossom.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are produced from distinctive traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.  Decaffeinated at the Descamex plant in Mexico by the “Mountain Water Process” which does not involve use of solvents. Old Soul is a roastery, bakery and crafter of artisanal goods dedicated to quality in every form. Visit www.oldsoulco.com or call 916-443-7685 for more information.
The Bottom Line: This very light-roasted decaffeinated coffee may suggest a fine, complex Chinese black tea in some respects, though it ultimately enforces its coffee identity with its tart structure and light-footed authority. Oddly idiosyncratic in its aromatics, but quite free of the disturbing wood notes characteristic of many decaffeinated coffees.

A.R.C., whose motto is “more than specialty,” rigorously controls three vital elements: sourcing of green coffee, roasting, and, in cafe environments, water quality for brewed coffee. For more information, visit http://www.arc.coffee/en/index.html.
The Bottom Line: A cup with a fine-tea-like appeal in its subtle complexity and spice-toned presentation.

Blind Assessment: Rich, sweet-toned, balanced. Nougat, pink peppercorn, lemongrass, roasted cacao nib, tea rose in aroma and cup. Floral-toned, bittersweet structure; delicate, satiny mouthfeel. Notes of aromatic wood and spice-toned florals carry the gently drying finish.
Notes: Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Like virtually all southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops.

Blind Assessment: Spectacularly sweet and hugely aromatic. Meyer lemon marmalade, cedar, pistachio, guava, jasmine in aroma and cup. Crisply sweet/tart and massively juicy in structure; plush, buoyant mouthfeel. The juicy structure and complex aromatics persist in a long, lingering finish.   
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 2 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2017.  Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500 foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced entirely from trees of the distinguished SL-28 variety of Arabica, the most celebrated of the Bourbon-derived tree varieties responsible for Kenya’s finest coffees. This SL-28 was grown at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm and processed with the ferment step conducted “dry” (no water added to the tank) using a commercial yeast. It is a limited edition coffee only available for sale through the allocation list on the Hula Daddy website. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Sweetly pungent, lightly savory. Unusual aromatics: floral-toned honey, plum, musk, a hint of coriander in aroma and cup. Crisply sweet, savory-edged structure; lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Dry and gently flavor-saturated in the finish.
Notes: Produced from trees of the SL28, SL34 and Ruiru 11 varieties of Arabica and processed by the wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Despite grower discontent and urban encroachment on prime coffee lands, Kenya continues to produce some of the world’s most elegant and distinctive coffees.

Big Creek Coffee Roasters is a small, quality-oriented batch roaster located in Montana’s Bitterroot Valley. Visit www.bigcreekcoffeeroasters.com or call 406-375-7508 for more information.
The Bottom Line: Spicy-sweet, autumnal profile, complex and grown-up.

Blind Assessment: Delicate, sweetly tart. Strawberry, caramel, musk, cocoa butter, magnolia in aroma and cup. Quietly tart-leaning structure with sweet undertones; plush, syrupy body. The perfumy, almost musk-like finish is characterized by tart fruit notes in the short and cocoa butter in the long.
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of 71 organic-certified coffees from Africa for Coffee Review’s November 2017 tasting report. Produced by the METAD farm and mill in southern Ethiopia. Southern Ethiopia produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Certified USDA organic. Based in southern Oregon, Noble Coffee is a wholesale and retail roasting company focused on quality, social responsibility and environmental consciousness. Visit www.noblecoffeeroasting.com or call 541-488-3288 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A richly elegant cup that leads with deep fruit notes, as do many natural- processed coffees, though here the fruit is complicated by an engaging musk-like intrigue.

Blind Assessment: Deeply sweet, fruit- and cocoa-toned. Baker’s chocolate, dried coconut, tea rose, almond, cedar in aroma and cup. Fruit-toned structure with round, gentle acidity; crisp though syrupy mouthfeel. The spice-toned finish suggests homemade fruitcake, with notes of dried fruit, nuts and warming spices. 
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a tasting of 71 organic-certified coffees from Africa for Coffee Review’s November 2017 tasting report. Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Like virtually all southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. Certified USDA organic. Named after the cofounders’ son, Ben, Ben’s Beans prides itself on ethical sourcing, as well as in donating a portion of proceeds to charities in the coffee-producing regions they work with. Visit www.bensbeans.org for more information.
The Bottom Line: The overall impression of this natural-processed Yirgacheffe cup is equal parts dried fruit and chocolate, nicely elaborated by spice suggestions (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg).

Blind Assessment: Sweetly pungent, richly savory-toned. Blackberry jam, roasted cacao nib, rhododendron, sundried tomato, nougat in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory structure with crisp, floral acidity; viscous, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. The finish is sweet-toned and balanced, with lingering notes of berry and cocoa.
Notes: This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a tasting of holiday coffees for Coffee Review‘s December 2017 tasting report. Comprised entirely of the much admired, bold-bean Pacamara variety of Arabica, a cross between the giant-beaned Maragogipe variety and Pacas, a selection of the heirloom Bourbon. Processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin of the coffee fruit is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. Los Congos, established in 1997, is an award-winning farm run by the Paguaga family, leading Nicaraguan coffee producers for several generations. Dragonfly Coffee is a Boulder, Colorado-based micro-roaster that produces high-quality coffees and supports worthy causes.

Blind Assessment: Complex, uniquely sweet, tropical. Plumeria, roasted cacao nib, mango, sandalwood, nougat in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with bright, juicy acidity; syrupy mouthfeel. The finish carries through on the promise of the cup, with rich florals in the short and deep fruit notes in the long, where a new element, a soft fruit tone suggesting coconut, surfaces.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 8 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2017, and it earned the highest rating in a tasting of holiday coffees for Coffee Review‘s December 2017 tasting report. Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by farmer Roberto Brenes of Auromar Estate. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is a dry-processed or “natural” Gesha, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Willoughby’s Coffee & Tea is a pioneer specialty coffee roaster established in the early 1980s that has gracefully and successfully moved with the times and now offers a menu of extremely refined small-lot, single-origin coffees. Visit www.willoughbyscoffee.com or call 800-388-8400 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A dynamic coffee with complex aromatics that invoke the tropics—and a seemingly infinite finish, richly sweet and flavor-saturated.

Blind Assessment: High-toned, richly sweet. Strawberry guava, roasted cacao nib, lime zest, jasmine, almond in aroma and cup.

Blind Assessment: Spice-toned, richly sweet. Raspberry, dark chocolate, hazelnut, gardenia, bergamot in aroma and cup. Sweet, fruit-forward structure; full, satiny mouthfeel. The resonant, flavor-saturated finish is characterized by notes of rich chocolate with berry and bittersweet citrus complications.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a tasting of holiday coffees for Coffee Review‘s December 2017 tasting report. Produced entirely from trees of the respected Catuai variety of Arabica. The Lamastus family’s Elida Estate averages the highest growing elevations in Panama: 5,500 to 8,200 feet (1,700 to 2,500 meters). This is a “natural” or dry-processed coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than the more familiar wet-processed coffees of Panama.

Blind Assessment: Sweet, deep, intense but balanced. Peach, maple syrup, sandalwood, grapefruit zest, almond, magnolia in aroma and cup. Round, resonantly and sweetly bright in structure. Silky and buoyant in mouthfeel. Deep, long, flavor-saturated finish.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 10 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2017. Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a rare variety of Arabica that is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was produced in Kona, Hawaii and processed with the ferment step conducted “dry” (no water added to the tank) using a commercial yeast. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500 foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This rare coffee is only available on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.
The Bottom Line: Intense, bright but balanced cup with layered aromatic intrigue generated by a celebrated and rare tree variety.

Blind Assessment: Crisply and sweetly tart, delicate yet confident. Peach, vanilla bean, grapefruit zest, almond, pink peppercorn in aroma and cup. Poised in structure: sweet, tart, savory. Mouthfeel is cushiony, plush. Flavor saturates a savory-edged, drying finish.
Notes: Produced on the single-family Muchoki Estate from trees of the admired Bourbon-derived SL-28 variety of Arabica together with the Ruiru 11 variety. AB is the second-highest grade of Kenya coffee based on bean size and freedom from physical defects. Despite grower discontent, confusing government coffee policy and urban encroachment on prime coffee lands, Kenya continues to produce some of the world’s most elegant and distinctive coffees. Klatch Coffee is an award-winning small-batch roasting company in the Los Angeles area with a long list of recognitions and awards achieved both by the company and by key team members, like resident trainer Heather Perry, who won both the 2003 and 2007 United States Barista Championships brewing a Klatch Coffee espresso blend, and Klatch Wholesale Account Manager Todd Goldsworthy, two-time United States Brewers Cup winner.

Balanced, roundly and gracefully sweet/tart in structure. Light-footed and plush in mouthfeel. Flavor consolidates around jasmine, sandalwood and banana in a sweet, lasting finish.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 22 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2017.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Crisply sweet-tart. Frangipane, dark chocolate, cedar, tamarind, jasmine in aroma and small cup. Crisp, velvety mouthfeel; nut-toned, richly tannic finish. In cappuccino-scaled milk, invitingly bittersweet, with notes of dark chocolate and jasmine in harmony.
Notes: Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Like virtually all southern Ethiopia coffees, produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. In addition to his retail roasting operation, Aroma Roast Coffees, Simon Hsieh also operates Soaring Phoenix Trading, a business focused on purpose-built commercial espresso blends and high quality single-origin coffees. Visit www.facebook.com/4ArtsZeroDefectCoffees or call 886-0983-749876 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Sweetly pungent, floral-toned. Rhododendron, fine musk, black cherry, sandalwood, roasted cacao nib in aroma and cup. Balanced, bittersweet structure; velvety-smooth mouthfeel. The finish consolidates to cocoa-toned florals in the short and sweet aromatic wood notes in the long.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. When processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying, as here), they typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity with a particular emphasis on floral notes. Like virtually all southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. Black Coffee in Black Jar, a Taiwan-based nano-roaster and café, is named for both the Taiwanese colloquialism “black soy sauce in black jar,” indicating something is difficult to see through, and the literal black jar this company stores coffee in to protect it from UV light. For more information, visit https://m.facebook.com/BlackCoffeeInBlackJar/.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Sweetly and crisply pungent. Dark chocolate, gently scorched cedar, ripe plum, floral vanilla, a hint of port wine in aroma and small cup. Full, syrupy mouthfeel. Dark chocolate dominates in a roundly drying finish. Fills out three parts milk with depth and authority: vanilla, chocolate, continuing hint of port wine.  
Notes: This blend is unusual in the context of leading-edge small North American roasting companies, because it contains a significant percentage of coffee of the Robusta species, in this case a speciality Robusta from southern Thailand, which undoubtedly contributes in particular to its plush, syrupy mouthfeel.

Notes: Doi Pangkhon is an emerging growing district in the Golden Triangle region of northern Thailand.

Blind Assessment: Intensely rich, deeply sweet, complex. Chocolate fudge, lavender, grapefruit zest, moist perique-style tobacco, coconut-covered date in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweetly savory in structure with lively acidity; buoyant, syrupy mouthfeel. The flavor-laden finish offers chocolate-toned spicy florals in the short resolving to rich date notes with undertones of perique tobacco in the long.
Notes: Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are admired for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet hulling.” This is a splendid example of the potential of the type. Ulos Batak is the name applied by the cooperative exporter Klasik Beans to a premium grade of its small-producer wet-hulled coffee from the Lintong region south of Lake Toba. Lintong is one of the longest-established growing regions in Sumatra and probably the most admired. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet, crisply complex, spice-toned. Lilac, bergamot, white peach, caramelized walnut, sandalwood in aroma and cup. Delicate, sweetly tart, juicy in structure; crisp, satiny mouthfeel. The quietly resonant finish is flavor-saturated: stonefruit and bergamot carry the short and sandalwood-nuanced lilac notes resurface in the long.
Notes: Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) grown on Price Peterson’s Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world. With its bold, boat-shaped beans and distinctive floral and crisply cacao-toned cup, the Gesha continues to be one of the world’s most sought-after coffees, and the Esmeralda versions remain among the most authentic. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Roasted at PT’s Coffee, where the motto is “without the love, it’s just coffee.” Visit www.ptscoffee.com or call 888-678-5282 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A symphonic Gesha cup: high-toned fruit and flowers are supported by spice and aromatic wood.

Blind Assessment: Delicate, crisply sweet. Dried coconut, baker’s chocolate, candied violet, cedar, nutmeg in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweet-tart structure; silky mouthfeel. The gently drying finish is carried by notes of chocolate-toned coconut in the short and cedar in the long, with a whisper of sweet candied violet.
Notes: Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by farmer Roberto Brenes of Auromar Estate. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is a dry-processed or “natural” Gesha, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Roasted at PT’s Coffee, where the motto is “without the love, it’s just coffee.” Visit www.ptscoffee.com or call 888-678-5282 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A crisp, deeply sweet natural-processed Gesha cup: chocolaty, fruit-toned and floral.

Blind Assessment: Engaging, richly sweet-savory. Caramelized fig, earthy pipe tobacco, aged rum, hibiscus, cinnamon in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure; velvety-smooth mouthfeel. The long finish consolidates to cinnamon and caramelized fig, with a hint of aged rum.
Notes: Haraz (also Haraaz, other spellings) is a celebrated coffee growing region in north-central Yemen, west of the capital of Sana’a. Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea Arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Yemeni coffee is still grown from ancient heirloom cultivars of arabica on stone-walled terraces ringing fortress-like mountaintop villages. All Yemen coffees are natural-processed, or dried in the whole fruit. Roasted at PT’s Coffee, where the motto is “without the love, it’s just coffee.” Visit www.ptscoffee.com or call 888-678-5282 for more information.
The Bottom Line: An attractively idiosyncratic cup from one of coffee’s ancient homelands: mildly fermenty, richly fruity-toned, with hints of earth and tobacco.

Elegant, savory-leaning structure with bright, juicy acidity; plush, velvety mouthfeel. The resonant, flavor-laden finish is centered around floral-toned fruit, with supporting notes of dark caramel and fine musk.
Notes: Produced by David Mburu Mwangi at his farm in Kenya’s Kiambu East District from trees of the Ruiru 11, SL28 and SL34 varieties of Arabica. Despite challenges ranging from contested government coffee policy and urban encroachment on prime coffee lands to chronically unstable weather, Kenya continues to produce some of the world’s most elegant and distinctive coffees.

Blind Assessment: Sweet-toned, fruit-forward. Raspberry, cedar, baker’s chocolate, gardenia, molasses in aroma and cup. Bittersweet structure; velvety mouthfeel. The crisp, gently drying finish leads with notes of chocolate-toned berries in the short, and spicy-sweet florals and aromatic wood notes in the long.
Notes: Certified organic. Produced entirely from trees of the Kona Typica variety of Arabica. This is a “natural” or dry-processed coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than profiles associated with the more typical wet or “washed” process (fruit is removed before drying). Hala Tree Coffee is a family-owned organic Kona coffee farm located near Captain Cook village, in the heart of the Kona coffee belt, overlooking historic Kealakekua Bay. The USDA organic-certified property now produces 100% Kona coffee that is processed and roasted on site to ensure quality in each bag of coffee. For more information, visit www.halatreecoffee.com.

Blind Assessment: Intense, dynamic, richly sweet-savory. Passionfruit jam, baker’s chocolate, aromatic orchid, sandalwood, almond in aroma and cup. Bright, sweetly tart in structure; full, velvety mouthfeel. The resonant finish is crisply sweet, with layers of complex fruit and floral notes in the short, consolidating to baker’s chocolate and almond in the long. 
Notes: Produced by smallholding farmers from trees of the Ruiru 11, Batian, SL28 and SL34 varieties of Arabica. Despite grower discontent and urban encroachment on prime coffee lands, Kenya continues to produce some of the world’s most elegant and distinctive coffees. This particular sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Speckled Ax is a roaster based in Portland, Maine, specializing in high-quality certified organic and small-lot coffees. The company roasts in a vintage wood-fired Petroncini roaster with the goal of highlighting each coffee’s best attributes. Visit www.speckledax.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A classic Kenya cup: richly sweet-savory, with a complex array of fruit, floral, chocolate and aromatic wood notes at its intense and inviting heart.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Deeply expressed dark chocolate, magnolia-like flowers, grapefruit zest, date, cedar in aroma and small cup. Lean, though very smooth mouthfeel; chocolate-toned finish with hints of cedar. The chocolate deepens in three parts milk, enlivened by continued suggestions of magnolia and grapefruit.
Notes: Honduras, until recently a largely overlooked Central American coffee origin, has been producing increasing volumes of fine coffee over the past decade. Produced entirely from trees of the Catuai variety of Arabica and processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin of the coffee fruit is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

Blind Assessment: Richly savory, sweetly herb-toned. Baker’s chocolate, fennel, black cherry, cedar, wisteria-like flowers in aroma and cup. Round, deeply sweet in structure; syrupy mouthfeel. The cocoa-toned finish leads with black cherry in the short, which settles into a cedar-toned flowers in the long. 
Notes: The cup profile of this coffee owes its originality to a complex, overlapping set of influences. First, tree variety: It was produced from heirloom varieties grown only in southern Ethiopia. Second, processing method: It was processed using a variation of the honey method, in which only the skins are removed from the coffee fruit and the beans are dried still enveloped in all or part of the fruit pulp. Finally, the beans were exposed to cultured strains of bacteria extracted from the excrement of the civet cat, making this a laboratory version of the famous kopi luwak, the coffee passed through the intestines of a civet cat or luwak. Good Chance Biotechnology., Ltd. is a Taiwan-based specialty coffee company. For more information, visit http://www.magiccat.pro/ or email [email protected]
The Bottom Line: An impressively rich sweet-savory cup with a throughline of fennel-like herb notes. Interesting both for its unusual cup and its unusual processing variation.

Blind Assessment: Delicately sweet-tart, fruit-toned. Strawberry, aged rum, cocoa powder, pink peppercorn, celery seed in aroma and cup. Sweetly fermenty in structure; satiny-smooth in mouthfeel. A hint of aged rum carries the finish, accompanied by berry notes in the short and spice-toned savory notes in the long.
Notes: The cup profile of this coffee owes its originality to a complex, overlapping set of influences. First, tree variety: It was produced from heirloom varieties grown only in southern Ethiopia. Second, processing method: It is a “natural” or dry-processed coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than profiles associated with the more typical wet or “washed” process the which the soft fruit residue is removed before drying. Finally, the beans were exposed to cultured strains of bacteria extracted from the excrement of the civet cat, making this a laboratory version of the famous kopi luwak, the coffee passed through the intestines of a civet cat or luwak. Good Chance Biotechnology., Ltd. is a Taiwan-based specialty coffee company. For more information, visit http://www.magiccat.pro/ or email [email protected]
The Bottom Line: A Sidamo coffee processed by the dry or natural method and treated with a cultured essence of kopi luwak that together net richly ripe fruit notes, cocoa tones, and a pleasing hint of sweet ferment.

Blind Assessment: Gently bittersweet, deeply floral-toned. Baker’s chocolate, aromatic orchid, hazelnut, oak in aroma and cup. Low-toned, crisply bittersweet in structure. Mouthfeel is light though silky. The finish consolidates to a rich, oaky chocolate.   
Notes: Ka’u is an emerging Hawaii coffee-growing district centered approximately 30 miles southeast of the famous Kona region. This Ka’u is produced by the Palehua Ohana Cooperative of small-holding Ka’u farmers, an organization dedicated to impeccable socio-economic and environmental practices. Carbonic maceration is an innovative variation on the wet or “washed” method, in which the whole coffee fruit is fermented in a carbon-dioxide rich environment before the fruit residue is removed and the beans are dried. The goal is to improve the clarity and sweetness of fruit notes. The method is being pioneered by Sasa Sestic, an Australian barista champion. Visit www.kauspecialtycoffee.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: Delicately bittersweet and cocoa-toned, with flowers hinting at lushness.

Blind Assessment: Complex, fruit-forward. Ripe strawberry, dark chocolate, frankincense, pink peppercorn, aged rum in aroma and cup. Bittersweet structure animated by a bright, juicy acidity; delicately lively, smooth mouthfeel. The resonant finish is flavor-saturated, leading with berry notes with a hint of sweet ferment in the short, rounding to spice-toned chocolate in the long.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are produced from distinctive traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Like virtually all southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. This is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Black Coffee in Black Jar, a Taiwan-based nano-roaster and café, is named for both the Taiwanese slang phrase “black soy sauce in black jar,” indicating something is difficult to see through, and the literal black jar this company stores coffee in to protect it from UV light.

The Bottom Line: A regal and expressive natural-processed Ethiopia coffee with an inviting hint of clean, sweet ferment suggesting aged rum.

Blind Assessment: Resonantly fruit-forward, elegant, complex. Honey, dried raspberry, chocolate truffle, aged rum, a hint of marjoram in aroma and cup. Juicy, rich structure with bright, vibrant acidity; full, satiny mouthfeel. A suggestion of sweet marjoram complicates the rich, flavor-saturated finish, which leads with honey and raspberry notes in the short, rounding to chocolate and aged rum in the long.

Blind Assessment: Crisply sweet, spice-toned. Dried papaya, caramel, tangerine zest, pink-peppercorn, vanilla in aroma and cup. High-toned, sweetly tart in structure with juicy, bright acidity; lean, though satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The resonant, richly drying finish is laden with sweet notes of caramel and papaya in the short, turning more savory-leaning in the long, with hints of pink peppercorn wrapped in vanilla. 
Notes: Produced by David Gomez of of El Balso Farm entirely from trees of the Caturra variety of Arabica. Like almost all Colombia coffees, this coffee is wet-processed or “washed,” meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Huila is one of Colombia’s most respected coffee-growing regions. Husband and wife team Samantha and Weston Nawrocki founded Manzanita Roasting on their family’s 127-year-old winery in San Diego. Committed to quality direct-trade sourcing and skillful roasting, they are happy to be a part of what they call San Diego’s new “coffee frontier.” Visit www.manzanitaroasting.com for more information.

Blind Assessment: Crisp, elegantly sweet-savory. Baker’s chocolate, lemon blossom, fine musk, dried peach, almond in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweetly tart in structure; delicate, satiny mouthfeel. The richly drying finish consolidates to chocolate-toned stone fruit, with a hint of fine musk.
Notes: With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Acatenango is the name of a coffee-growing municipality as well as a famous volcano overlooking the Antigua Valley of Guatemala. This coffee was processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying).

Blind Assessment: Resonantly bright, floral-toned. Jasmine, frankincense, cardamom, toffee, apricot in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweetly tart structure with juicy acidity; crisp, velvety mouthfeel. The deep, flavor-saturated finish leads with caramel-toned apricot in the short, with rich florals resurfacing in the long. 
Notes: Regrettably, this fine coffee sold out before the publication of our review. Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by farmer Roberto Brenes of Auromar Estate. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is a dry-processed or “natural” Gesha, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. This sample also consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Based in the San Diego area, Bird Rock Coffee Roasters is a retailer and wholesaler focused on organic and socially responsible coffees; it was awarded the “2012 Micro-Roaster of the Year” title from Roast Magazine. Visit www.birdrockcoffee.com or call 858-551-1707 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A vibrant, exhilarating natural-processed peaberry Gesha saturated with rich floral, spice and fruit aromas and flavors throughout the profile.

Blind Assessment: Deeply rich, spicy sweet. Pear, cedar, vanilla, grapefruit zest, cumin in aroma and cup. Tartly bittersweet in structure; full, syrupy though drying mouthfeel. Resonant finish consolidates around pear and a floral-toned vanilla. 
Notes: Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex aromatic wood and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” This is a refined example of the type. A.R.C., whose motto is “more than specialty,” rigorously controls three vital elements: sourcing of green coffee, roasting, and, in cafe environments, water quality for brewed coffee.

Notes: Produced by the father-son team of Alberto and Diego Guardia from trees of the Venecia variety, a mutant selection of the sturdy, compact-growing Caturra that withstands heavy rains, among other agronomic virtues.

Blind Assessment: Fruit-forward, delicate yet intense. Complex flowers (lily to lavendar), sandalwood, dark chocolate, plum, a hint of brandy in aroma and cup. Roundly and deeply crisp in structure; lightly satiny in mouthfeel. The finish is resonant and sweet with chocolate and a continuing hint of brandy.
Notes: Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Like virtually all southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Sweet-savory, intense, balanced. Spicy-toned flowers, tangerine zest, red berries, cedar, dark chocolate, roasted cashew in aroma and small cup. Syrupy but buoyant mouthfeel. Flowers, chocolate and citrus all carry into a resonant though slightly drying finish. Gently and sweetly citrusy in three parts milk, with a continued backgrounded chocolate and nut. 
Notes: Produced by Omar Arango in the Tolima Department of Colombia from trees of the respected Caturra and Catuai varieties of Arabica. This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Chocolate Fish is a distinguished New-Zealand-inspired micro-roaster based in Sacramento California, focused on the best in both quality and integrity. Visit www.chocolatefishcoffee.com or call 916-451-5181 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A quietly zesty straight shot nicely rounded and deepened with chocolate and nut. All carry nicely into cappuccino-scaled milk.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Rich, deeply roast-toned. Dark-chocolate, ripe pear, scorched sandalwood, tangerine zest, honeysuckle-like flowers in aroma and small cup. Syrupy, plump mouthfeel; resonant finish is dry but alive with aromatics: dark chocolate, sandalwood, hints of flowers and tangerine. Dry but deep, chocolaty and nuanced in three parts milk.
Notes: Produced by about 150 small-holding farmers of the remote Biftu Gundina Cooperative. Ethiopia coffees like this one are produced from distinctive traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in their regions. Produced by villagers on small garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. This is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.
The Bottom Line: A fine darker roasted espresso: The scorched wood notes are lively and aromatic, the chocolate pleasingly bittersweet; hints of zesty citrus and sweet flowers maintain vivacity.

Blind Assessment: Roundly and sweetly citrusy. Ripe tangerine, caramel, freesia-like flowers, cedar, a hint perhaps of fresh parsley-like herb in aroma and cup. Sweetly and gently tart, pure and juicy in structure. Very smooth, fullish, satiny mouthfeel. Flavor consolidates in a layered, resonant finish. 
Notes: Produced from locally naturalized cultivars of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica and processed at the now famous Bufcafe mills. Epiphanie Mukashyaka established the first Bufcafe washing station or wet mill following the Rwandan genocide and the loss of most of her family. She and her son now operate two wet mills and a dry mill in the area. Processed by the conventional wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. A wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying using a particularly complex dry-ferment, wash and soak procedure popular in Rwanda.

Its motto is “Tough Town, Great Coffee.” Visit www.durangocoffee.com or call 800-748-2275 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Crisp, richly and sweetly tart. Candied apple, magnolia, cashew butter, sassafras, pomegranate in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart in structure with juicy acidity; velvety-smooth mouthfeel. The richly drying, subtle finish centers around notes of nut butter and sweet florals.
Notes: This coffee is available exclusively as a part of the Barrington Coffee Curated Collection, four ounces each of three distinguished coffees for $29.95. This selection is produced by Francisca and Oscar Chacon at Las Lajas farm from trees of the Caturra, Catuai and Villa Sarchi varieties of Arabica and processed by the red honey method. With all honey processing methods, some sweet pulp or fruit flesh (“honey”) is allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. In the red honey variation, all or almost all of the pulp is allowed to dry on the beans, rather than only a portion of it, as would be the case with yellow honey. Barrington Coffee is an artisan roaster dedicated to elite coffees, fresh delivery and roasting that foregrounds the coffee and not the roast. Visit www.barringtoncoffee.com or call 800-528-0998 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A honey-processed Costa Rica cup expressing equal parts sweet and tart: think candied apple and pomegranate wrapped in rich, creamy cashew butter.

Blind Assessment: Delicate, crisply sweet-savory, roast-rounded. Dark chocolate, orange blossom, almond, sandalwood, tamari in aroma and cup.

Blind Assessment: Deeply sweet, richly wood-framed. Watermelon candy, sandalwood, narcissus-like flowers, toasted pecan, maple syrup in aroma and cup. Bittersweet structure; crisp, satiny mouthfeel. Aromatic wood leads in the short finish, while notes of watermelon candy (think Jolly Rancher) and sweet florals resurface in the long.
Notes: Produced by Martin Urena of La Chumeca Farm entirely from trees of the respected Red Catuai variety of Arabica. This is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of Value Coffees for Coffee Review‘s March 2018 tasting report. Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” Produced in the Lintong region south of Lake Toba, one of the oldest and arguably the most admired of Sumatra growing regions.

This coffee tied for the top rating in a cupping of Value Coffees for Coffee Review‘s March 2018 tasting report.

Blind Assessment: Balanced and bright with a savory, root-vegetable depth. Lemon verbena, ripe orange zest, roasted cacao nib, rhododendron, a hint of brothy cooked root vegetables in aroma and cup. Structure is quietly sweet/tart with a savory edge; the mouthfeel round, syrupy and full. The finish is richly drying, consolidating around cacao nib and a ripe zesty orange.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of Value Coffees for Coffee Review‘s March 2018 tasting report. Produced from locally naturalized cultivars of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica and processed at the now famous Bufcafe mills. Epiphanie Mukashyaka established the first Bufcafe washing station or wet mill following the Rwandan genocide and the loss of most of her family. She and her son now operate two wet mills and a dry mill in the area. Processed by the conventional wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. A wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying using a particularly complex dry-ferment, wash and soak procedure popular in Rwanda. Mr. Espresso is a San Francisco Bay Area wholesale roaster and espresso parts distributor that slow-roasts its coffees using traditional wood-fired roasting machines. Visit www.mrespresso.com or call 510-287-5200 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A fine expression of the classic Rwanda and Central Africa cup, vibrantly and roundly bright, yet crucially deepened and nuanced by drier and more savory suggestions of lemon verbena and cooked root vegetables.

Blind Assessment: Sweet-toned, earthy-rich. Cocoa powder, pipe tobacco, hibiscus, moist fallen leaves, hazelnut butter in aroma and cup. Savory-leaning structure with brisk acidity; satiny mouthfeel. Notes of cocoa-toned pipe tobacco predominate in the short finish, while hibiscus and foresty fallen-leaf notes figure prominently in the long.

Notes: Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet hulling.” Black Coffee in Black Jar, a Taiwan-based nano-roaster and café, is named for both the Taiwanese slang phrase “black soy sauce in black jar,” indicating something is difficult to see through, and the literal black jar in which this company stores coffee to protect it from UV light. For more information, visit https://m.facebook.com/BlackCoffeeInBlackJar/.
The Bottom Line: A deeply sweet, earth-toned Sumatra cup, with enveloping notes of pipe tobacco and rich nut butter.

Blind Assessment: Crisp, delicate, yet intense and original. Lush, rose-like flowers, dark chocolate, cedar, almond, ripe pineapple in aroma and cup. Balanced and complete in structure, poised at a round, satisfying intersection of sweet, tart and bitter. Light but syrupy in texture. Layered and resonant in the finish: rose, chocolate, almond all ring on.
Notes: Mocca (also spelled Moka and Mokka) is a famous variety of Arabica that reached Kaanapali, Hawaii from Brazil. Current thinking in the technical coffee community is that it originated in the Reunion Islands as a mutant of the great Bourbon variety. I continue to feel that it must have some direct relationship with Yemen, however, where varieties displaying the same, very unusual bean size and shape are known as Ismaili, as well as by other local names. This Mocca was processed by the dry or “natural” method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. This rare coffee with its tiny beans and striking cup is available only on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500 foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.
The Bottom Line: An out-of-the-ordinary coffee but a superbly balanced and complete one, with particularly seductive floral and chocolate notes.

Blind Assessment: Bright, richly sweet. Lime blossom, raspberry jam, sandalwood, roasted cacao nib, maple syrup in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart in structure with juicy acidity; viscous, buoyant mouthfeel. The finish leads with citrus and berry notes in the short, segueing to sandalwood-framed sweet florals in the long.
Notes: Produced entirely from trees of the Kurume and Welicho varieties of Arabica at Suke Quto farm. Processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin of the coffee fruit is removed, as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. This coffee is both organic- and Rainforest Alliance-certified. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.
The Bottom Line: This honey-processed Ethiopia is a citrus and berry chorus, from lime blossom in the aroma to raspberry jam in the cup, backed by continuous suggestions of sandalwood and crisp cacao nib.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet, fruit-toned. Raspberry jam, almond butter, rhododendron-like flowers, grappa, cocoa powder in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with fruit-forward acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish consolidates around deep raspberry and cocoa notes, with a heady hint of sweet ferment.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees roasted by women for Coffee Review‘s April 2018 tasting report. Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is rounder and lower-toned than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. This coffee is certified organically grown and Fair Trade certified, meaning it was purchased at a “fair” or economically sustainable price. Worka is one of twenty-two primary cooperatives located in the Gedeo Zone of Southern Ethiopia organized as the Yirgacheffe Farmers Union. Established in 2010, Red Rooster is an organic-certified micro-roaster focusing on socially conscious coffee and high-quality coffee. Visit redroostercoffee.com or call 540-745-7338 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A natural-processed Ethiopia cup with sweetly jammy fruit character, balanced by cocoa suggestions.

Blind Assessment: High-toned, richly sweet-savory. Mango, honey, lemongrass, oak, narcissus in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweetly savory structure with lively acidity; crisp though velvety mouthfeel. The sweetly herb-toned finish is redolent of lemongrass, supported by mango, honey and a hint of oak.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees roasted by women for Coffee Review‘s April 2018 tasting report. Produced by the METAD farm and mill in southern Ethiopia. Southern Ethiopia produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Coffees like this one processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp is removed before drying) typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity with a particular emphasis on citrus and floral notes. Certifed USDA organic. Tico Coffee’s co-founder Mariana Faerron is from Costa Rica, and the word “Tico” refers to a Costa Rica native. The company she created with her husband Thomas specializes in direct trade coffees from small farms all over the world. Visit www.ticoroasters.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A crisp, high-toned Ethiopia coffee with rich fruit and sweet herb notes, next to deep evocations of honey.

Blind Assessment: Intensely rich, sweetly savory. Dried raspberry, aged rum, paprika, pipe tobacco, wisteria-like flowers in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory in structure with gentle acidity; full, velvety mouthfeel. The flavor-saturated finish fulfills the promise of the cup, carrying over each of the distinct fruit, earth, spice and chocolate notes, together with a hint of sweet ferment suggesting aged rum.
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees roasted by women for Coffee Review‘s April 2018 tasting report. Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Yemeni coffee is still grown from ancient heirloom cultivars of Arabica on stone-walled terraces ringing fortress-like mountaintop villages. All Yemen coffees are natural-processed, i.e., dried in the whole fruit. Imported by Mokhtar Alkhanshali of Port of Mokha Coffee, who has worked with farmers to improve their harvesting and drying procedures, and who selects and meticulously transports microlots like this one to the U.S. Founded in 1995, Equator Coffees & Teas is a women-owned wholesale coffee roasting company that focuses on sustainability in coffee-sourcing and business practices. Visit www.equatorcoffees.com or call 800-809-7687 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Lush, high-toned, richly sweet. Apricot, bergamot zest, nougat, sandalwood, honeysuckle in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet in structure, with juicy, bright acidity; plump, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish is seemingly eternal, resonant with all the flavor notes from the cup: stone fruit, citrus zest, nutty caramel, aromatic wood and sweet florals.
Notes: This sample earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees roasted by women for Coffee Review‘s April 2018 tasting report. Produced by Orlando Espina of Finca La Maria entirely from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also spelled Geisha), this coffee won second place in the 2017 Colombia Cup of Excellence. With its elegantly elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Based in the San Diego area, Bird Rock Coffee Roasters is a retailer and wholesaler focused on organic and socially responsible coffees; it was awarded the “2012 Micro-Roaster of the Year” title by Roast Magazine.

Blind Assessment: Intensely pungent, richly vibrant, deeply sweet, startlingly original. Complex spice (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg), herb (fresh cilantro, parsley), baker’s chocolate, lime zest, sweetly pungent spirits (Brazilian cachaça?) in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet and roundly tart in structure. Full, syrupy mouthfeel. The shifting, layered intrigue in the cup carries far into a long, resonant finish.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 5 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2018.  Comprised entirely of beans from the rare Sudan Rume, a presumably very old variety of Arabica originally selected from wild trees growing on the Boma Plateau of Sudan, close to the border with Ethiopia. Processed by the dried-in-the-fruit or natural method. Produced by Rigoberto Herrera at Granja La Esperanza in Colombia, an innovative producer that specializes in impressive and innovative work with unusual cultivars of Arabica.  Roasted at PT’s Coffee, where the motto is “without the love, it’s just coffee.” Visit www.ptscoffee.com or call 888-678-5282 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Layered, complex. Dark chocolate, mango, grapefruit zest, cedar, lily-like flowers in aroma and small cup. Lightly syrupy, lively mouthfeel. Mango, chocolate and a hint of flowers persist in a deeply resonant finish. Crisply lively in three-parts milk: continued chocolate and mango-like fruit, while the floral suggestions hint at butterscotch. 
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are produced from traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. A wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Like virtually all southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops.

The Bottom Line: Fine wet-processed Ethiopia skillfully medium-roasted for presentation as espresso. Layered and pleasingly shifting aromatics persist throughout, from aroma through the milk shot.

Flavor consolidates in a rather dry though pleasingly chocolate- and cedar-toned finish. Crisp in three-parts milk: dry chocolate and rich floral hints.

Blind Assessment: Crisp, richly sweet-savory. Maple syrup, gardenia-like flowers, fresh humus, pomegranate, baker’s chocolate in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet in structure, with savory undertones; delicate, silky mouthfeel. The finish is driven by gardenia-like florals and sweet earth tones in the short, baker’s chocolate and tart fruit in the long.
Notes: Produced by Lambertus Siba Hurek entirely of the Typica variety of Arabica and processed by the Indonesia wet-hulled method. Flores is an island in Indonesia, part of a chain of islands that extends east of Java and Bali. With a recent focus on quality and assistance from international aid groups, Flores is beginning to create a name for itself in specialty coffee circles. Green Stone Coffee is a woman-owned artisan roastery in Taipei, founded in 2016 and specializing in sourcing distinctive coffees that express their individual terroirs.

Blind Assessment: Crisp, sweetly tart. Concord grape, baker’s chocolate, cedar, musk, magnolia in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweet-tart in structure with juicy acidity; full, satiny mouthfeel. The resonant finish leads with fruit and floral tones, rounding to baker’s chocolate in the long. 
Notes: Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also spelled Geisha). With its elegantly elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is in extremely refined presentation of the Gesha variety developed by boutique exporter/importer Ninety Plus Coffee. Processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin of the coffee fruit is removed, as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.
The Bottom Line: An elegant, crisply sweet honey-processed Gesha cup with a throughline of pleasingly tart fruit notes enveloped in chocolate.

Blind Assessment: Fruit-forward, spice-toned. Raspberry jam, clove, rum cordial, fresh-cut fir, dried hibiscus in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with brisk acidity; lightly creamy mouthfeel. Clove and raspberry drive the sweet-toned short finish, while notes of fresh-cut fir reappear in the long.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are produced from distinctive traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Like virtually all southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Evie’s Café , based in Chia-Yi Taiwan, specializes in fine roasted coffees as well as pour-overs and cold-brews. Visit https://m.facebook.com/eviescafe88/ for more information.
The Bottom Line: A delicate, flavor-saturated natural-processed Sidamo cup, animated by notes of raspberry and clove.

Blind Assessment: Delicate, sweetly spice-toned. Peach blossom, hazelnut, pink peppercorn, lime zest, cedar in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart in structure with lively, balanced acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish consolidates to peach blossom and hazelnut in the short, with lime zest and cedar resurfacing in the long.
Notes: Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also spelled Geisha). With its elegantly elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is an extremely refined presentation of the Gesha variety developed by boutique exporter/importer Ninety Plus Coffee. Produced in very small lots, it is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. In the case of this coffee the drying was carried out in a temperature- and moisture-controlled solar drier, a proprietary method developed by the Ninety Plus team.

Blind Assessment: Crisp, sweetly savory. Butterscotch, mesquite, cocoa powder, cooked acorn squash, fine musk in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory in structure with brisk acidity; lightly syrupy mouthfeel. The finish is carried, both short and long, by notes of cocoa and rich aromatic wood.
Notes: Toarco (TOraja ARabica COffee) is a coffee project in the famous Sulawesi coffee growing region of Toraja developed and financed by Japan’s Key Coffee Company and its Indonesian partners. Toarco coffees are processed by variants of the orthodox wet or washed method, giving them a brighter and cleaner profile than Sulawesi coffees processed by the locally traditional wet-hulling method. Until recently Toarco sold its entire production to the Japanese market, making this coffee rare in the United States. Espresso Republic, founded in 2010, specializes in sourcing quality coffees and roasting them in small batches for both retail and wholesale customers.

Blind Assessment: Elegant, bright, very sweetly pungent. Starfruit, frankincense, lime zest, roasted cacao nib, narcissus in aroma and cup. Richly sweet in structure with balanced, vivacious acidity. Delicate, silky mouthfeel. The floral-toned finish starts and ends with notes of narcissus, punctuated by starfruit, cacao nib and bittersweet citrus suggesting lime zest, all enveloped in perfumy aromatic wood redolent of frankincense.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 23 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2018. Burundi is a small, landlocked country in Central Africa. Most coffee is grown in the mountains of the north, bordering Rwanda. Benefiting from ideal growing conditions and large plantings of Bourbon and related heirloom varieties of Arabica, Burundi coffee has an excellent reputation and a growing following among North American specialty roasters.

Blind Assessment: High-toned, richly sweet-tart. Baker’s chocolate, hibiscus tea, floral vanilla, tangerine zest, brown sugar in aroma and cup. Sweetly bright in structure, with gentle acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The sweetly tart finish is gently drying, consolidating around notes of hibiscus tea and baker’s chocolate.
Notes:  This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from Brazil for Coffee Review’s May 2018 tasting report. As a green coffee, it also took seventh place in the 2017 Cup of Excellence juried competition for natural or dry-processed Brazil coffees, meaning coffees that were dried in the entire fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet- or “washed”-processed coffees.

Blind Assessment: Fruit-toned, chocolaty. Strawberry, dark chocolate, sandalwood, lavender, a hint of brandy in aroma and cup. Brisk, sweet-tart structure with juicy acidity; delicate, silky mouthfeel. Reminiscent of a chocolate cordial in the sweetly fermenty finish.
Notes:  This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from Brazil for Coffee Review’s May 2018 tasting report. Produced by the children of Nagipe Viana Klem, founder of Fazenda Klem, entirely from trees of the respected Catuai variety of Arabica. This is a “natural” or dry-processed coffee, which means the beans or seeds were dried encased in the entire fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet- or “washed”-processed coffees.

Balanced, sweet-savory-tart structure with vibrant acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. The crisp, flavor-saturated finish centers around sweet fruit and floral notes and an intriguing savory inclination.
Notes:  Produced in the Lintong region south of Lake Toba, one of the oldest and arguably the most admired of Sumatra growing regions.

Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 7 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2018.

All Yemen coffees are natural-processed, or dried in the whole fruit. This is a particularly refined, elegant example of the this ancient style.

Blind Assessment: Sweetly spice-toned, deeply rich. Bergamot, almond, fresh parsley, gardenia, oak in aroma and cup. Crisply sweet, softly tart in structure; plush, full mouthfeel. The rich, resonant finish carries over all the notes from the cup, a nut-toned bergamot in particular.
Notes: Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety, Gesha. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. It was produced by boutique exporter/importer Ninety Plus Coffee. Dragonfly Coffee is a Boulder, Colorado-based micro-roaster that produces high-quality coffees and supports worthy causes.

Blind Assessment: Wildly, disconcertingly original. Sweetly tart, simultaneously fruit- and earth-toned, bright yet lush. Fresh clover, earth, fresh-pressed red grape juice, dark chocolate, white peppercorn in aroma and cup. Juicy sweet yet zesty and savory in structure. Full, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish is resonant and intensely flavor-saturated. 
Notes: Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees.

The Bottom Line: For well-heeled coffee adventurers, a coffee so original it is difficult to categorize. It provokes a tremendous range of sensory association that situates it on the frontier of coffee expression, hovering somewhere between disturbing and extraordinary.

Blind Assessment: Crisply sweet, fruit-toned. Blackberry, baker’s chocolate, freesia, hazelnut, cedar in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with bright acidity; velvety-textured, crisp mouthfeel. The cocoa-toned finish has a berry throughline, enveloped by spicy floral notes.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees roasted by women for Coffee Review‘s April 2018 tasting report. Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are produced from distinctive traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Founded in 2014 by Ingin Kim, an investor in the boutique coffee producer Ninety Plus, Peri Coffee is a nano-roaster based in Altadena, California. Visit www.pericoffee.com for more information.

Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 10 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2018.

Blind Assessment: Rich-toned, subtly complex. Pineapple, sandalwood, jasmine, honey, cocoa in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet in structure with juicy acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant finish leads with cocoa-toned pineapple in the short, rounding to jasmine in the long.

Notes: Produced entirely from trees of the Red Bourbon variety of Arabica and grown on Hula Daddy’s higher farm at 2,500 feet. This presentation is named for co-owner Karen Paterson, whose middle name is Jue and whose favorite coffee is the Red Bourbon. This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees roasted by women for Coffee Review‘s April 2018 tasting report. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500 foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Multi-layered, intricate. Raspberry, chocolate fudge, lavender, vanilla, rum cordial in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart in structure with fruit-toned acidity; lightly syrupy mouthfeel. The finish is crisp and richly drying, with notes of chocolate and lavender in the short and fruit-infused rum in the long.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees roasted by women for Coffee Review‘s April 2018 tasting report. Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Argyle Coffee Roasters aims to provide people the opportunity to drink better coffee through education, outreach, and creating connections. Visit www.argylecoffeeroasters.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: An elegant natural-processed Yirgacheffe cup, complex with rich fruit and chocolate throughout.

Blind Assessment: Deeply sweet, richly savory. Lemongrass, graham cracker, sassafras, roasted cacao nib, jasmine in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory structure, with round acidity; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The short finish is resonant with notes of lemongrass and jasmine, rounding to cocoa and graham cracker in the long.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees roasted by women for Coffee Review‘s April 2018 tasting report. Ka’u is a newly emerged Hawaii coffee-growing district centered approximately 30 miles southeast of the famous Kona region. This coffee combines two small lots of the Typica variety that were processed using variations on the wet or “washed” method, one of which involved applying a yeast especially designed for coffee during the fermentation step (the Oro brand yeast developed by Lalcafe). This 100% Ka’u coffee was developed by Lorie Obra of Rusty’s, one of Ka’u’s best-known and most celebrated farms. Obra meticulously picks, processes and roasts her coffees using traditional methods and artisan attention. Visit www.rustyshawaiian.com or call 808-928-8916 for more information.
The Bottom Line: Innovative practices during the ferment step of fruit removal appear to have encouraged intensified aromatic originality and depth in this traditional Big Island Typica. Floral, richly herb-toned, deeply sweet.

Blind Assessment: Richly savory, deeply sweet. Ginger blossom, almond brittle, pear, fresh, moist forest notes, wildflower honey in aroma and cup. Structured balance among sweet, tart and savory tastes; crisp, velvety mouthfeel. The honey-toned finish leads with ginger blossom in the short and notes of pear and almond in the long.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 11 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2018. This coffee earned the second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from the Great Lakes region of Africa for Coffee Review’s June 2018 tasting report. Produced entirely from trees of the Bourbon variety of Arabica by members of the SOPACDI coop. Located overlooking Lake Kivu, on the opposite side of the lake from Rwanda, this rapidly growing cooperative now has 5,600 members and apparently is succeeding in its goal to help heal wounds left by the latest in eastern Congo’s seemingly endless string of horrific rebellions and civil wars. A wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. This coffee is certified organically grown and certified fair trade, meaning it was purchased at no less than a minimum price determined by the certifying agency to be economically sustainable for the farmers. Dragonfly Coffee is a Boulder, Colorado-based micro-roaster that produces high-quality coffees and supports worthy causes. Visit www.dragonflycoffeeroasters.com or call 303-579-2154 for more information.
The Bottom Line: One of the finest Congos we've cupped in years: spice-toned, floral, tantalizingly sweet-savory, with a throughline of rich earth tones evoking a forest walk after a rain.

Blind Assessment: Delicate, complex, chocolate-toned. Dried mulberry, dark chocolate, fine musk, pipe tobacco, pink peppercorn in aroma and cup. Sweetly savory structure with juicy acidity; plump, smooth mouthfeel. The finish, which consolidates to notes of dark chocolate and dried mulberry, is confident and flavor-saturated.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from the Great Lakes region of Africa for Coffee Review’s June 2018 tasting report. Produced entirely of the Bourbon variety of Arabica and processed at the Buraza Community/Mahonda Washing Station. Burundi is a small, landlocked country in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa.

Blind Assessment: Nuanced, multi-layered, richly sweet. Lavender, roasted cacao nib, salted caramel, sweet aromatic mushroom, a moist foresty hint in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet-savory in structure with bright, juicy acidity; plush, velvety mouthfeel. The finish is resonant and flavor-saturated, fulfilling the promise of the cup well into the long.
Notes: Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also spelled Geisha) by Pablo Guerrero. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. The majority of Gesha coffees are grown in the Boquete region of Panama, but there is increased experimentation with this variety throughout Latin America, especially Colombia, where this exceptional version was grown. Dragonfly Coffee is a Boulder, Colorado-based micro-roaster that produces high-quality coffees and supports worthy causes. Visit www.dragonflycoffeeroasters.com or call 303-579-2154 for more information.
The Bottom Line: An exciting Colombia Gesha cup that covers all the aromatic and gustatory bases: spicy florals notes, sweetly savory earth tones, umami sensations and rich sweetness throughout.

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink bottled black coffee tested over ice. Brisk, bittersweet, lively. Apricot, roasted cacao nib, walnut, blood orange zest, a hint of tea rose. Tart-sweet in structure with a bracing bitter edge; satiny in mouthfeel. Flavor consolidates around hints of apricot and walnut in a drying finish.

Notes: This coffee tied for the fifth-highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink bottled black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2018 tasting report. Sold in 12-ounce cans. Prepared by the cold-brew method, which involves prolonged steeping of ground coffee in cold or room-temperature water and subsequent filtering. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. The green coffee used to produce the tested beverage is a blend of 50% Kenya AA and 50% wet-processed or “washed” Ethiopia.

Notes: Coffees like this one from the celebrated Yirgacheffe region are largely produced from traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. The Curve Coffee Roasting Co. holds classes authorized by the Specialty Coffee Association, as well as roasting and selling around 30 specialty coffees, including rare Taiwan origins.

Blind Assessment: Sweetly earth-toned, spice-forward. Aromatic orchid, moist fresh-fallen leaves, cashew, cinnamon. Bing cherry in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart-structure with crisp acidity; plush, full mouthfeel. The finish is resonant and richly drying, with leading notes of aromatic orchid and cherry in the short and oak and cinnamon in the long.
Notes: Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” Produced in the Lintong region south of Lake Toba, one of the oldest and arguably the most admired of Sumatra growing regions. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

The Bottom Line: A complex, harmonious Sumatra cup, with sweetly tart fruit and deeply sweet floral notes enveloped in rich earthiness.

Notes: This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from the Great Lakes region of Africa for Coffee Review’s June 2018 tasting report. Produced by Ben and Christy Carlson of Long Miles Coffee Project in Burundi. Benefiting from ideal growing conditions and large plantings of local strains of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica, Burundi has recently emerged as a premier Africa fine coffee origin. This is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

Notes: This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from the Great Lakes region of Africa for Coffee Review’s June 2018 tasting report. Processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin of the coffee fruit is removed, as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. Benefiting from ideal growing conditions and large plantings of local strains of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica, Burundi has recently emerged as a premier Africa fine coffee origin.

Blind Assessment: Rich-toned, deeply and sweetly earthy. Chocolate fudge, white sage, blackberry, perique pipe tobacco, plumeria-like flowers in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweet-savory structure with vibrant, juicy acidity; delicate, satiny mouthfeel. The resonant, flavor-saturated finish displays notes of blackberry and tobacco in the short, plumeria and sage in the long, and deep chocolate throughout. 
Notes: This coffee was grown by indigenous Batak people, who have been involved in coffee production since the practice was brought to Sumatra by the Dutch in the late 19th century. Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are admired for their complex aromatic wood and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums. Visit www.jbccoffeeroasters.com or call 608-256-5282 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A multi-layered Sumatra cup with berry and tropical flowers as primary notes, balanced with fine pipe tobacco, sweet herbs and rich chocolate.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet, roast-toned. Dried black cherry, vanilla, singed mesquite, baker’s chocolate, nutmeg in aroma and cup. Bittersweet structure with round, gentle acidity; velvety mouthfeel. The resonant finish leads with notes of black cherry and nutmeg in the short, rounding to vanilla-toned chocolate in the long, all supported by an inviting undercurrent of smoky aromatic wood notes.
Notes: Zambia is a rare origin now, owing to the ravages of drought. Nevertheless, this version reflects the Zambia profile of some years ago, round and softly balanced, with the Africa floral and citrus/berry notes subdued but still distinct. Mystic Monk Coffee is a small-batch roaster associated with a Carmelite monastery located in the Rocky Mountains of northern Wyoming. The monks emphasize an artisan approach to roasting and a commitment to quality. Visit www.mysticmonkcoffee.com or call 877-751-6377 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Spicy, earth-toned, lightly roasty. Dark chocolate, fresh-turned earth, gently scorched oak, pipe tobacco, hints of peppercorn and sweet flowers in aroma and cup. Vibrantly sweet-savory in structure. Plush, velvety mouthfeel. Chocolate in particular carries into a round, resonant finish, complicated by continued hints of tobacco, earth and flowers.
Notes: Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” Produced in the Lintong region south of Lake Toba, one of the oldest and arguably the most admired of Sumatra growing regions. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

Blind Assessment: Fruit-toned, engagingly complex. Mulberry, musk, cocoa, freesia-like flowers, elderflower liqueur in aroma and cup. Balanced in structure (sweet, tart, savory); plush, lively mouthfeel. The resonant finish leads with fruit (think berry medley) in the short, while the long is characterized by spice-toned florals and a hint of sweet ferment.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are produced from distinctive traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Small Eyes Cafe is a small, family-owned coffee shop in Yilan, Taiwan, specializing in artisanally roasted specialty coffee and homemade desserts. Visit https://www.facebook.com/Smalleyescafe for more information.

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink bottled black coffee tested over ice. Richly sweet with an umami undercurrent. Baker's chocolate, ripe tomato, vanilla, tangerine zest, lavender. Vivacious, sweet-tart structure with a compelling umami anchor. Crisp, full mouthfeel. Notes of ripe tomato, baker's chocolate and lavender carry the long, layered  finish.

Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 21 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2018. This coffee earned the highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink bottled black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2018 tasting report. Sold in retro 750-ml (25.4-ounce) corked bottles.

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink bottled black coffee tested over ice. Briskly vivacious and intricate. Complex berry notes (blueberry, strawberry), almond, sandalwood, lilac-like flowers. Sweetly bright in structure; full and lightly syrupy in mouthfeel. Flavor persists without loss of distinction with added whole milk. A nitro (nitrogenated) version of this blend displayed a livelier mouthfeel though somewhat less clearly articulated flavor.

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink bottled black coffee tested over ice. Full, intriguingly fermenty. Dark chocolate, tangerine zest, Concord grape, fresh vanilla, a hint of tequila barrel. Pungent, richly sweet-tart in structure with a sweet-salty edge; impressively full and smooth/syrupy in mouthfeel. The finish is woody but fragrant with tequila-barrel pungency.

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink bottled black coffee tested over ice. Crisp, rich, caramel-toned. Caramel, lemon zest, date, hazelnut, oak. Balanced structure with briskly sweet acidity; feathery-smooth mouthfeel. The finish is deeply sweet, richly caramelly, with hints of lemon zest and hazelnut. The addition of whole milk elevates caramel, already front and center, to dessert-like dominance.

Notes: This coffee tied for the fifth-highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink bottled black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2018 tasting report. Sold in 12-ounce bottles. Prepared by the cold-brew method, which involves prolonged steeping of ground coffee in cold or room-temperature water and subsequent filtering. No additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. The green coffee used to produce the tested beverage is a single-origin coffee from Guatemala. Barefoot Coffee is an award-winning small-batch roasting company with a roastery, two cafés, a mobile coffee bar and robust coffee education programs in California’s Silicon Valley. Visit www.barefootcoffee.com or call 408-293-7200 for more information.
The Bottom Line: An easy-drinking, richly sweet cold-brew coffee, caramel- and nut-toned, with hints of lemon zest.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Bright, lively, sweet-toned. Bergamot, cherry, magnolia, roasted cacao nib, almond in aroma and small cup. Velvety mouthfeel; sweetly tart, richly drying finish. Cherry tones come forward in three parts milk, supported by deep chocolate.
Notes: This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a tasting of natural-processed single-origin espressos for Coffee Review’s August 2018 tasting report. Produced by Anny Pimentel entirely from trees of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica and processed by the natural method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Old Soul is a roastery, bakery and crafter of artisanal goods dedicated to quality in every form. Visit www.oldsoulco.com or call 916-443-7685 for more information.
The Bottom Line: An inviting natural-processed El Salvador coffee, sweetly tart in the straight shot and richly fruit- and cocoa-toned in milk.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Crisply sweet, spice-toned. Roasted cashew, gardenia, apricot, cardamom, baker’s chocolate in aroma and small cup. Satiny mouthfeel; richly layered finish with notes of chocolate and faintly smoky aromatic wood. Crisply and persuasively chocolaty in three parts milk.
Notes: This coffee earned the fifth-highest rating in a tasting of natural-processed single-origin espressos for Coffee Review’s August 2018 tasting report.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Richly floral, spice-toned. Lavender, baker’s chocolate, dried strawberry, sandalwood, lemon zest in aroma and small cup. Full, syrupy mouthfeel; dry, fruit-toned finish with hints of sandalwood. In three parts milk, chocolate notes turn toward sweet caramel and the spicy floral and dried berry notes amplify. 
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of natural-processed single-origin espressos for Coffee Review’s August 2018 tasting report. “Twakok” comes from the words “tafac,” which means “sweet” and “kok,” which means “peach.” Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Like most southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email kah[email protected] for more information.
The Bottom Line: This brisk natural-processed Ethiopia espresso presents a fruit note that’s a dead ringer for dried strawberries (supported by notes of lavender and sandalwood) and is especially attractive in cappuccino-scaled milk.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Bright, floral, spice-toned. Spearmint, black cherry, cedar, tangerine zest, plumeria-like flowers in aroma and small cup. Plush and buttery in mouthfeel. Flavor consolidates to cocoa-toned citrus in a resonant finish. In three parts milk, an elegant cocoa surfaces, with supporting notes of sweet flowers and a hint of pungent cedar.
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of natural-processed single-origin espressos for Coffee Review’s August 2018 tasting report. A blend of natural-processed coffees from the Shakiso, Guji, Oromia and Sidamo growing regions of Ethiopia. Southern Ethiopia coffees like these are largely produced from distinctive traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. The components of this blend are dry-processed or “natural” coffees, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

The Bottom Line: An espresso blend trifecta that leads in equal parts with fruit, flowers and herbs (think black cherry, plumeria and spearmint, respectively).

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Rose-like flowers, chocolate fudge, cannabis flower, black cherry, fresh-cut cedar in aroma and small cup. Syrupy, vibrant mouthfeel; richly drying, sweet-savory finish. This coffee levitates in three parts milk, with rich notes of rose-like flowers ensconced in deep chocolate and a cannabis-like muskiness.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 24 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2018.  This coffee tied for the highest rating in a tasting of natural-processed single-origin espressos for Coffee Review’s August 2018 tasting report. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety of Arabica continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s rarest and most unique coffees. Although the Gesha originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It was grown in western Ethiopia by farmers Adam and Rachel Overton and their indigenous Meanit culture collaborators from seed selected from wild trees in the nearby Gori Gesha forest. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the soft fruit residue has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Small Eyes Café is a small, family-owned coffee shop in Yilan, Taiwan, specializing in artisanally roasted specialty coffee and homemade desserts. Visit https://www.facebook.com/Smalleyescafe for more information.
The Bottom Line: A strikingly original natural-processed Ethiopia Gesha, with high-toned floral notes, a suggestion of musky cannabis, and a complex, exhilarating presence in milk.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Lush, complex, richly sweet-savory. Peach, fine musk, cocoa powder, freesia-like flowers, pungent frankincense in aroma and small cup. Plump, syrupy mouthfeel; clean, crisp, cocoa-toned finish. The cocoa notes from the small cup bloom into dark chocolate in cappuccino-scaled milk, nicely complicated by flowers and frankincense.
Notes: This coffee tied for the highest rating in a tasting of natural-processed single-origin espressos for Coffee Review’s August 2018 tasting report. Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Like virtually all southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the soft fruit residue has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Helen Chen, of Taokas Studio Coffee, is a Taiwan-based nano-roaster whose specialty coffees are available via her Facebook shop: https://goo.gl/4YPoAd.
The Bottom Line: A natural-processed Ethiopia roasted for espresso that shimmers with an intricately layered range of sensation: sweet, savory, spice, floral, chocolate, fruit, expressed both in the straight shot and in milk.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Apricot, lychee, sandalwood, cashew butter, honeysuckle in aroma and small cup. Creamy-smooth mouthfeel; rich finish that surfaces herb notes suggesting marjoram, along with lychee and apricot. In three parts milk, this coffee is fruit-driven, its tartness tempered by honeysuckle and sandalwood notes.
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of natural-processed single-origin espressos for Coffee Review’s August 2018 tasting report. Haraz (also Haraaz, other spellings) is a celebrated coffee growing region in north-central Yemen, west of the capital of San’a. Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Yemeni coffee is still grown from ancient cultivars and sun-dried, usually on the roofs of stone houses. This is a particularly refined example of the type. Dragonfly Coffee is a Boulder, Colorado-based micro-roaster that produces high-quality coffees and supports worthy causes. Visit www.dragonflycoffeeroasters.com or call 303-579-2154 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A powerhouse espresso from this ancient origin, assertively fruit-toned and elegantly floral.

Blind Assessment: Richly low-toned, gently zesty. Cedar, baker’s chocolate, grapefruit zest, apple, a hint of magnolia-like flowers in aroma and cup. Sweetly and quietly tart in structure, with a brisk edge. Plump mouthfeel. Flavor consolidates in a sweet, though rather drying, finish.

Blind Assessment:  Evaluated at proportions of 5 grams of instant coffee powder mixed with 8.5 ounces (250 ml) of hot water. Cloyingly sweet and definitively burned. Salted caramel, burned building, some cinnamon and floral top notes in aroma and cup. The structure is salty and bitter; the mouthfeel lean and watery. Hints of flavor fade in a finish that simply tastes burned.
Notes: This coffee was reviewed for a tasting of soluble or “instant”coffees for Coffee Review’s September 2018 tasting report. This is an instant Via version of the medium- (actually dark-) roasted Colombia, a Starbucks standby. Based on our reading of the cup, this Via Colombia intimated taints in the green coffee and clumsiness in the roast that are not typical of Starbucks’ whole-bean Colombia offerings. Visit www.starbucks.com for more information.

 
The Bottom Line: Not much survives the dark roast and the solubilizing, and what does is not particularly pleasing.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet, balanced, intricately layered. Frankincense, almond nougat, honeysuckle, dried black cherry, roasted cacao nib in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweet-savory structure with juicy acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant, cocoa-toned finish is supported by notes of dried black cherry and honeysuckle.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 12 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2018. Produced entirely from trees of the Maracaturra variety of Arabica. Maracaturra is a cross between the workhorse, compact-growing variety Caturra (itself a mutant of the heirloom Bourbon) and the rare, huge-beaned Maragogipe, making it a parallel variety to the better-known Pacamara, a cross between Maragogipe and Pacas (also a mutant selection of Bourbon). This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Roasted at PT’s Coffee, where the motto is “without the love, it’s just coffee.” Visit www.ptscoffee.com or call 888-678-5282 for more information.

 
The Bottom Line: A lovely example of the big-beaned Maracaturra variety: sweetly savory with notes of deep stone fruit and rich, sweet florals.

Blind Assessment: Delicately rich, crisply sweet. Star jasmine, lemon zest, peach, sandalwood, almond in aroma and cup. Roundly and sweetly tart in structure; lightly silky in mouthfeel. Lemon, peach and sandalwood in particular carry into a long finish, deeply layered finish. 
Notes: Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Yirgacheffe coffees like this one processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying) typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity with a particular emphasis on floral notes. Almost all Yirgacheffe coffees are produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.

Blind Assessment: Richly floral- and berry-toned, impeccably balanced. Violet, blackberry, honey, clove, salted chocolate in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with rounded, lively acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish leads with notes of violet and blackberry in the short, modulating to salted chocolate in the long.
Notes: Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Like virtually all southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. Green Stone Coffee is a woman-owned artisan roastery in Taipei, founded in 2016 and specializing in sourcing distinctive coffees that express their individual terroirs.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso produced as a ristretto 25ml (.85-ounce) shot using a Nespresso capsule espresso brewer with whole milk heated using a conventional steam wand. Sweetly bright, intricate, original. Peach, sandalwood, lemon tart, baker’s chocolate, rhododendron-like flowers in aroma and small cup. Delicately plump in mouthfeel; long, resonant, peach- and lemon-saturated finish. Remains crisply tart in three parts milk, with flavor consolidating around a subtle, elegant dry chocolate.  
Notes: One of the world’s most celebrated coffees presented in a Nespresso-compatible capsule. Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) grown on Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world. With its bold, boat-shaped beans and distinctive floral and crisply cacao-toned cup, the Gesha continues to be one of the world’s most celebrated and sought-after coffee varieties, and the Esmeralda versions remain among the most authentic. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso produced as a ristretto 25ml (.85-ounce) shot using a Nespresso capsule espresso brewer with whole milk heated using a conventional steam wand. Crisp, very sweet, delicately seductive. Cocoa, raisin, roasted cashew nut, sweet alyssum flowers in aroma and small cup. Light and velvety in mouthfeel; flavor consolidates but lingers in a persistent, balanced finish. Quiet but superb in three parts milk: flowers and cocoa come forward pleasingly.  
Notes: This coffee took first place in the 2016 Brazil Cup of Excellence juried competition for green coffees processed by the pulped natural method, meaning that the outer skin of the coffee fruit is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. It was produced on Fazenda Santa Barbara in the distinguished Chapada Diamantina growing region. Cup of Excellence competitions are arguably the coffee world’s most rigorous and prestigious of juried green coffee competitions. Difference Coffee aims to present only the finest of the world’s coffees as determined by green coffee competitions and other measures of distinction, tactfully roasted and presented in capsules compatible with Nespresso capsule brewing systems.

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink bottled black coffee tested over ice. Sweetly brisk yet juicy; original. Flavor notes of crisp, fruit-toned cocoa, fresh-cut cedar, raspberry, passionfruit, violet-like flowers. Satiny, lively mouthfeel. Long finish resonating with cedar, fruit and flowers. Whole milk turns the cedar toward almond, the cocoa toward full-on chocolate, the tart fruit jammy.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 17 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2018.  Sold in attractive 8.4-ounce cans. Sourced and roasted by Bird Rock Coffee and extracted by a proprietary version of room-temperature brewing trademarked Rain by the BKON company.Contains no ingredients other than coffee and water. The green coffee used to produce this beverage is a single-origin coffee from Finca las Margaritas in the admired Valle de Cauca growing region. It was produced entirely from trees of the heirloom Red Bourbon variety of Arabica, and was processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. Bird Rock Coffee Roasters is a retailer and wholesaler focused on organic and socially responsible coffees; it was awarded the “2012 Micro-Roaster of the Year” title by Roast Magazine. Visit www.birdrockcoffee.com or call 858-551-1707 for more information.
The Bottom Line: An original cold-brew profile, sweet yet crisp, complexly fruit-toned, refreshing without loss of authority.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Crisply sweet, richly floral-toned. Lavender, dark chocolate, red currant, almond butter, pink grapefruit zest in aroma and small cup.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Elegantly fruit-toned and floral. Dried apricot, lychee, sandalwood, cashew butter, honeysuckle in aroma and small cup. Plush, creamy mouthfeel; rich, resonant finish driven predominantly by notes of dried apricot and sandalwood. In three parts milk, an intriguing marjoram-like note surfaces, along with notes of deep fruit, aromatic wood, and a distinct sweet floral.
Notes: Yirgacheffe coffees like this one are largely produced from traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the wet-processed or “washed” floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Like virtually all coffees from the Yirgacheffe region, this coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated at proportions of 5 grams of instant coffee powder mixed with 8.5 ounces (250 ml) of hot water. Caramelly, cocoa-toned. Fresh fir, cocoa, salted caramel, roasted hazelnut, a hint of lily-like flowers in aroma and cup. Structure is sweet yet brisk, with a salty edge. Lean but smooth in mouthfeel. Flowers and cocoa in the short finish, fading to salty wood in the long.    
Notes: This coffee tied for the fifth-highest rating overall in a tasting of “instant” or soluble coffees for Coffee Review’s September 2018 tasting report. This is an instant Via version of the medium-roasted or “Blonde” Veranda Blend, which Starbucks describes as “mellow & soft.” It is apparently aimed at those who prefer a brisker, more delicate cup than presented by Starbucks’ more typical darker-roasted offerings. Visit www.starbucks.com for more information.

 
The Bottom Line: We enjoyed the caramel, nut and cocoa and the relative cleanness of the cup, though a salt-toned wood lurked.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated at proportions of 5 grams of instant coffee powder mixed with 8.5 ounces (250 ml) of hot water. Mainly burned, with some crisp liveliness. Heavily scorched fir with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and cinnamon in aroma and cup. Bitter and burned in structure, with a suggestion of sweetness. Light and lean in mouthfeel. Dry and roasty-wood-toned in the finish, with faint suggestions of chocolate and vanilla. 
Notes: This coffee was reviewed for a tasting of soluble or “instant” coffees for Coffee Review’s September 2018 tasting report. The KANU line is generally considered one of Korea’s premium instant coffees. More information on KANU in English can be found at modernseoul.org/2013/07/29/kanu-and-looka-premium-korean-instant-coffees/.

 
The Bottom Line: An ultra-dark French roast in instant format that manages to maintain some hints of flavor, while avoiding the sullen burned-building character of many dark- or ultra-dark-roasted instants.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated at proportions of 5 grams of instant coffee powder mixed with 8.5 ounces (250 ml) of hot water. Sweet, deep and juicy. Dark chocolate, jasmine, mango, orange zest, oak in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart in structure with an underlying salty, drying hint. Syrupy and plush in mouthfeel. Clean and sweet in the short finish: mango, jasmine, chocolate. Flavor fades quickly in the long.
Notes: This coffee earned the highest rating in a tasting of instant or soluble coffees for Coffee Review’s September 2018 tasting report. The green coffee was produced by the Layo Teraga Cooperative; it is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. This coffee was sourced and roasted by Augie’s Coffee in Redlands, California and solubilized and packaged as an instant by Voilá Coffee in Bend, Oregon. Augie’s Coffee Roasters’ mission is to create awareness about the often-overlooked beauties of coffee, from its growth and preparation to its diverse and delicate flavor possibilities.

Voilá Coffee was founded by Kent Sheridan in January, 2016 out of a desire to make specialty coffee approachable, while combining his love for exploring new coffees and roasters. Visit www.voila.coffee for more information.

 
The Bottom Line: The juicy, lushly sweet-tart character of a fine natural-processed Ethiopia largely makes it through the rigors of solubilizing in this top-of-the-line instant coffee.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated at proportions of 5 grams of instant coffee powder mixed with 8.5 ounces (250 ml) of hot water. Simple, balanced. Prominent cocoa, cedar, orange zest, a faint hint of flowers in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart in structure with a shadow of salt. Lightly syrupy in mouthfeel. Flavor holds, particularly cocoa, in the short finish, though a faintly salty wood prevails in the long.  
Notes: This coffee earned the fourth-highest rating in a tasting of “instant” or soluble coffees for Coffee Review’s September 2018 tasting report. The green coffee was produced by farmer Percy Pintado from trees of the Red Caturra, Yellow Caturra and Bourbon varieties of Arabica. This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. This coffee was sourced and roasted by Intelligentsia Coffee and solubilized and packaged as an instant by Sudden Coffee in San Francisco, California. Intelligentsia is a distinguished specialty roaster and a leader in sourcing and roasting small, exceptional lots of coffee. Visit www.intelligentsiacoffee.com for more information.

Visit www.suddencoffee.com for more information.

 
The Bottom Line: The balanced grace of Peru is sustained in this instant coffee. The cocoa notes are particularly pleasing, the hints of salty wood less so.

Blind Assessment: Crisply sweet-savory. Coconut, hibiscus, star anise, roasted cacao nib, cedar in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart in structure with bright acidity; delicate, silky mouthfeel. The finish centers around notes of coconut and hibiscus in the short with a hint of star anise in the long.

Blind Assessment: Delicately sweet-savory. Lemon verbena, pink peppercorn, dried papaya, honeysuckle, baker’s chocolate in aroma and cup. The structure nicely balances sweet and savory; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The herb-toned finish leads with notes of lemon verbena and papaya with baker’s chocolate as a throughline.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia produces distinctive coffees from traditional, largely indigenous varieties of Arabica long grown in the region.

Notes: Produced by Maria Elena Botto of Finca Nombre de Dios entirely from trees of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica.

Lively, silky-smooth mouthfeel; resonant, flavor-saturated finish. In cappuccino-scaled milk, jasmine and mango notes are further amplified, deepened by pungent musk underneath.

Deeply sweet-tart structure with bright, juicy acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant, flavor-saturated finish rings on with all of the notes from the cup.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 16 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2018.  This coffee earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees from U.S. Mountain States roasters for Coffee Review’s October 2018 tasting report. Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) grown on Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world.

Blind Assessment: Crisply sweet, fruit-toned. Raspberry, roasted cacao nib, honey, fresh-cut fir, freesia-like flowers in aroma and cup. Richly sweet-tart in structure with vibrant acidity; delicate, silky mouthfeel. The long, lasting finish centers around cocoa-toned honey and freesia.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from U.S. Mountain States roasters for Coffee Review’s October 2018 tasting report. Southern Ethiopia produces distinctive coffees from traditional, largely indigenous varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Caffeic is a family-owned, Montana-based roaster with a focus on sourcing and sharing the highest-quality coffees available. Visit www.caffeic.coffee for more information.
The Bottom Line: A sweetly fruit-forward natural-processed Ethiopia with spicy-floral intrigue.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Deep, richly chocolaty, sweetly tart. Dark chocolate, peach, candied almond, tangerine zest, magnolia-like flowers in aroma and small cup. Plush, satiny mouthfeel; resonant, long, bittersweet finish. In three parts milk, chocolate and magnolia-like flowers round and amplify.
Notes: Yirgacheffe coffees like this one are largely produced from traditional indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the wet-processed or “washed” floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Like virtually all coffees from the Yirgacheffe region, this coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. In addition to his retail roasting operation, Aroma Roast Coffees, Simon Hsieh also operates Soaring Phoenix Trading, a business focused on purpose-built commercial espresso blends and high quality single-origin coffees.

Blind Assessment: Crisply sweet, balanced. Baker’s chocolate, apricot, magnolia, cedar, almond in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart in structure with brisk acidity; velvety-smooth mouthfeel. The finish centers around apricot and magnolia in the short, with cedar and baker’s chocolate returning in the long.

Ethiopia coffees like this one processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp is removed before drying) typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity with a particular emphasis on citrus and floral notes. Santa Cruz-based North Coast Roasting Company has a global sourcing program for the highest-quality organic-certified green coffee, hand-roasted in small batches. Visit www.northcoastroasting.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A balanced washed-process Ethiopia cup with pleasing notes of stone fruit and baker’s chocolate as throughlines.

Blind Assessment: Roasty-sweet, richly chocolaty. Dark chocolate, gently scorched cedar, gardenia, grapefruit zest, roasted almond in aroma and cup. Briskly bittersweet in structure; satiny-smooth in mouthfeel. Notes of dark chocolate and smoky cedar carry the resonant finish.
Notes: This coffee is organic and certified fair trade, the latter meaning it was purchased from small-holding farmers at a “fair” or economically sustainable price. Produced by members of the (CODECH cooperative) from trees of the Caturra, Bourbon, Catuai and Pache varieties of Arabica. This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying.

The finish leads with lemon verbena and toffee in the short, segueing to spice-toned chocolate and hazelnut in the long.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region.

Notes: Produced by Anny Ruth Pimentel-Courson entirely from trees of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica and processed by the black honey method. With all honey processing methods, some sweet pulp or fruit flesh (“honey”) is allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. In the black honey variation, the beans are subjected to a slower drying process than is the case with yellow or red honey processing.

Blind Assessment: Deeply sweet, cleanly fruit-toned. Watermelon candy, black currant, sandalwood, lantana-like flowers, spice-toned chocolate in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with brisk acidity; lightly velvety mouthfeel. The crisp, flavor-saturated finish is resonantly fruit-toned, complicated by pretty notes of sandalwood.
Notes: Haraz (also Haraaz, other spellings) is a celebrated coffee growing region in north-central Yemen, west of the capital of San’a. Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Yemeni coffee is still grown from ancient cultivars and sun-dried, often on the roofs of stone houses. Direct Coffee, founded in 2005, is a roastery located in the scenic city of Hsinchu, Taiwan. For the past 13 years, Direct Coffee has specialized in searching for high-quality coffee beans and roasting them to display their unique and distinctive characteristics.

Blind Assessment: Richly fruit-toned. Ripe blueberry, dark chocolate, oak, agave syrup, rhododendron-like flowers in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned in structure with rounded acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant finish centers around deep blueberry and chocolate notes with a hint of oak.
Notes: Yirgacheffe coffees like this one are largely produced from traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the wet-processed or “washed” floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Like virtually all coffees from the Yirgacheffe region, this coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. GK provides quality specialty coffee to consumers and retailers. For more information, email [email protected] or call +886-919-314-513.
The Bottom Line: A cleanly fruit-forward natural-processed Ethiopia cup, redolent with ripe berry notes.

Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from big-bean varieties for Coffee Review’s November 2018 tasting report. Produced by Don Atilio Zepeda of Finca El Cerro entirely of the Pacamara variety of Arabica. The Pacamara is a big-beaned hybrid of the Bourbon-related Pacas and the huge-beaned Maragogipe, itself a mutant of the ancient Typica variety. This version was processed by the black honey method. With all honey processing methods, some sweet pulp or fruit flesh (“honey”) is allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. In the black honey variation, the beans are subjected to a slower drying process than is the case with yellow or red honey processing. Established in 2010, Red Rooster is an organic-certified micro-roaster focusing on socially conscious coffee and high-quality coffee. Visit redroostercoffee.com or call 540-745-7338 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Aromatically subtle, sweetly tart. Pie cherry, roasted cacao nib, pistachio, thyme, freesia-like flowers in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with juicy, vibrant acidity; viscous, syrupy acidity. The finish consolidates to notes of cocoa-toned pie cherry and freesia.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from big-bean varieties for Coffee Review’s November 2018 tasting report. Produced by Jose Antonio Cruz of La Huella farm entirely of the Yellow Pacamara variety of Arabica. The Pacamara is a big-beaned hybrid of the Bourbon-related Pacas and the huge-beaned Maragogipe, a mutant of the ancient Typica variety. Processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. Small Eyes Café is a small, family-owned coffee shop in Yilan, Taiwan, specializing in artisanally roasted specialty coffee and homemade desserts. Visit https://www.facebook.com/Smalleyescafe for more information.
The Bottom Line: An intriguing and original Pacamara cup with pretty hints of sweet herb alongside bright fruit notes.

Blind Assessment: Crisply sweet, rich-toned. Baker's chocolate, Bing cherry, hibiscus, oak, molasses in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet structure with pert acidity; velvety-smooth mouthfeel. Hibiscus and molasses lead the gently drying finish, with chocolate and oak resurfacing in the long.
Notes: This coffee earned the fourth-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from big-bean varieties for Coffee Review’s November 2018 tasting report. Produced by Mauricio Arturo Salaverria Caceres of Finca Himalaya, entirely from trees of the Pacamara variety of Arabica. The Pacamara is a big-beaned hybrid of the Bourbon-related Pacas and the huge-beaned Maragogipe, itself a mutant of the ancient Typica variety. This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying.

The Bottom Line: A solid, balanced Pacamara cup: richly sweet, with a chocolate throughline.

Blind Assessment: Crisply sweet, floral-toned. Roasted cacao nib, green grape, freesia, cedar, maple syrup in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with brisk acidity; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The finish consolidates to notes of cedar and cacao nib in the short with a hint of freesia in the long.
Notes: Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) grown on Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world. With its bold, boat-shaped beans and distinctive floral and crisply cacao-toned cup, the Gesha continues to be one of the world’s most celebrated and sought-after coffee varieties, and the Esmeralda versions remain among the most authentic. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying.

Blind Assessment: Rich-toned, resonantly floral. Wisteria, myrrh, almond nougat, lemon curd, dried cherry in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with zesty, bright acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish leads with tart lemon curd and cherry notes, followed by deep wisteria with an undercurrent of almond.
Notes: This coffee earned the second-highest rating in a tasting of holiday coffees for Coffee Review‘s December 2018 tasting report. Nekisse is a proprietary brand of Ethiopia coffee developed by Ninety Plus, a distinguished boutique developer and importer of innovative small-lot coffees from Ethiopia and Panama. Grown near Neji in the Sidama/Sidamo growing region, this is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

The Bottom Line: A floral-driven natural-processed Ethiopia Geisha that invokes a stroll under wisteria vines; tart fruit and sweet nut tones provide support and balance.

Blind Assessment: Complex, multi-faceted, spice-toned. Dahlia-like flowers, bergamot, almond, vanilla, roasted cacao nib in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with balanced, bright acidity; delicate, silky-smooth mouthfeel. Bergamot and vanilla-toned cocoa carry the quiet, balanced finish.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a tasting of holiday coffees for Coffee Review‘s December 2018 tasting report.  Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also spelled Geisha) by Pablo Guerrero. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. The majority of Gesha coffees are grown in the Boquete region of Panama, but there is increased experimentation with this variety throughout Latin America, especially Colombia, where this exceptional version was grown. Joe Van Gogh is a small-batch roasting company with a focus on certified organic coffees. In addition to its Internet store, it operates six coffeehouses in Durham, Chapel Hill and Greensboro, North Carolina. Visit www.joevangogh.com or call 919-644-0111 for more information.
The Bottom Line: Layers upon layers of spicy floral and fruit notes resonate in this natural-processed Gesha from Colombia.

Blind Assessment: Balanced, richly sweet, tart and savory. Fine musk, dried hibiscus flowers, perique (fermented) pipe tobacco, candy cap mushroom, apricot in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart-savory structure with punchy acidity; lightly creamy, viscous mouthfeel. The rich-toned finish centers around apricot and umami-redolent notes akin to candy cap mushroom.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a tasting of holiday coffees for Coffee Review‘s December 2018 tasting report.  It is organic and certified fair trade, the latter meaning it was purchased from farmers at a “fair” or economically sustainable price.

Sweet-tart in structure with lively, expansive acidity; crisp, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish consolidates to pretty notes of lavender and dark chocolate, with a hint of tangerine zest.

Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a tasting of holiday coffees for Coffee Review‘s December 2018 tasting report.

Blind Assessment: Big, round, deeply and pungently layered. Fragrant cedar, lavender, baker’s chocolate, Concord grape, a hint of mace in aroma and cup. Bittersweet and rich in structure; fat and plush in mouthfeel with a drying edge. Concord grape and cedar dominate in a continuing pungent but quite sweet finish. 
Notes: Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also spelled Gesha) on the Chiari family’s Finca Lerida Esplenderosa in Jaramillo under the management of family member Sonia Amoruso. With its elongated beans and distinctive cup, the Geisha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. In all honey processing methods, skins are removed, but some sweet pulp or fruit flesh (“honey”) is allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. In the black honey variation, virtually all of the pulp is allowed to dry on the beans and the beans may be subject to a particularly slow drying process, often netting a deep, pungent profile. Willoughby’s Coffee & Tea is a pioneer specialty coffee roaster established in the early 1980s that has gracefully and successfully moved with the times and now offers a menu of extremely refined small-lot, single-origin coffees. Visit www.willoughbyscoffee.com or call 800-388-8400 for more information.
The Bottom Line: Grapey sweetness working against a complex cedary, lavender-toned pungency distinguishes this intriguing black-honey-processed version of great Geisha cup.

Intricately sweet, high-toned, with bright, juicy acidity; lush, syrupy mouthfeel. The richly sweet finish consolidates to cocoa-toned mango supported by notes of frankincense.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet, floral-toned. Narcissus, roasted cacao nib, agave syrup, fir, red apple in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with gentle, rounded acidity; smooth, satiny mouthfeel. The gently drying finish centers around roasted cacao nib and narcissus-like floral notes.
Notes: Produced entirely from trees of the Castillo variety of Arabica. Processed by the wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. Espresso Republic, founded in 2010, specializes in sourcing quality coffees and roasting them in small batches for both retail and wholesale customers. Visit www.espressorepublic.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A crisply sweet Colombia cup driven by engaging floral notes and hints of red apple and fresh-cut fir.

Blind Assessment: Spice-toned, deep, resonant. Dried persimmon, perique (fermented) tobacco, cinnamon, dark chocolate, gardenia-like flowers in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory structure with engagingly citrusy acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish leads with dried persimmon and dark chocolate, followed by pipe tobacco and cinnamon.
Notes: Produced from trees of the admired SL-28 and SL-34 varieties of Arabica. Despite grower discontent and urban encroachment on prime coffee lands, Kenya continues to produce some of the world’s most elegant and distinctive coffees. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Bird Rock Coffee Roasters is a retailer and wholesaler focused on organic and socially responsible coffees; it was awarded the “2012 Micro-Roaster of the Year” title by Roast Magazine. Visit www.birdrockcoffee.com or call 858-551-1707 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A rich-toned Kenya carried by pleasing savory notes that support and balance the coffee’s deep sweetness.

Blind Assessment: Delicately but pungently floral. Narcissus-like flowers, baker’s chocolate, tart black currant, oak, roasted pistachio in aroma and cup. Crisply sweet and lightly savory in structure; plump and lightly syrupy in mouthfeel. Flowers, cocoa-like chocolate, pistachio in particular carry into a gently drying finish.
Notes: Finca El Aguila is owned by Mauricio Ariz and his sons. It occupies 63 hectares in Cantón Ojo de Agua, municipality of Chalchuapa, near the Santa Ana Volcano. A small portion of the farm is devoted to the production of SL 28, the tree variety most responsible the great coffees of Kenya. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version of the SL 28, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums.

Blind Assessment: Delicate, sweetly tart. Lemon drop, roasted cacao nib, pink peppercorn, almond, orange zest in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with bright, juicy acidity; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The resonant finish consolidates to notes of lemon drop and cocoa, with a hint of pink peppercorn.
Notes: Produced by the Nano Challa cooperative in Ethiopia’s Jimma Zone. Southern and western Ethiopia coffees like this one are produced largely from local, indigenous varieties of Arabica. When processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying) they typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity, with a particular emphasis on citrus, cocoa and floral notes.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Crisp, chocolate-toned and cedary. Dark chocolate, pecan, gently scorched cedar, ripe banana, tangerine zest in aroma and small cup. Lightly syrupy mouthfeel; roundly bittersweet in the finish: chocolate, cedar, tangerine. Cedar dominates in three parts milk, quietly enveloped by chocolate and ripe banana.
Notes: Produced at Finca Volcán Azúl from a mix of tree varieties. Processed by the dry or “natural” method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or ""washed"" coffees.

Blind Assessment: Enchantingly rich, intensely floral, unique. Dried black cherry, tea rose, Cognac, chocolate fudge, gently scorched almond wood in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet-savory in structure with crisp, apple-toned acidity; plump, syrupy mouthfeel. Exceptionally long finish that carries over all the aroma and flavor notes from the cup, plus an umami intrigue akin to candied bacon.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 1 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2018. Mocca (also spelled Moka and Mokka) is a famous variety of Arabica that reached Kaanapali, Hawaii from Brazil. Current thinking in the technical coffee community is that it originated in the Reunion Islands as a mutant of the great Bourbon variety. It may well have originated in Yemen, however, where varieties displaying the identical, very unusual bean size and shape are known as Ismaili, as well as by other local names. This Mocca was processed by the dry or “natural” method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. This rare coffee with its tiny beans and striking cup is available only on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500 foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A marvel of a coffee, inviting and esoteric, chimerical and grounded, all at once.

Notes: Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from indigenous varieties of Arabica long grown in the region.

The finish is resonant with all the aroma and flavor notes of the cup, leading with apricot and lilac in the short and cocoa-toned sandalwood in the long, all sustained by a deep, honeyish sweetness. 
Notes: Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Yirgacheffe coffees like this one processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying) typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity with a particular emphasis on floral notes. Almost all Yirgacheffe coffees are produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.
The Bottom Line: Dynamic, engaging, classic washed Ethiopia cup, propelled by sweet floral and juicy stone-fruit notes.

Blind Assessment: Elegantly fruit-toned, chocolaty. Dark chocolate, dried fig, oak, narcissus-like flowers, molasses in aroma and cup. Crisply sweet structure with balanced, vibrant acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish consolidates to notes of dried fig and molasses supported by a rich dark chocolate.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region.

Blind Assessment: Cleanly fruit-toned, delicately rich. Rum cordial, orange zest, coconut, plum, cedar in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with gentle, round acidity; plump, satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The inviting finish leads with coconut and plum in the short, with notes of cedar and rum cordial returning in the long.
Notes: This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a tasting of holiday coffees for Coffee Review‘s December 2018 tasting report. Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also spelled Gesha) by farmer Roberto Brenes of Auromar Estate. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Geisha/Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Willoughby’s Coffee & Tea is a pioneer specialty coffee roaster established in the early 1980s that has gracefully and successfully moved with the times and now offers a menu of extremely refined small-lot, single-origin coffees. Visit www.willoughbyscoffee.com or call 800-388-8400 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A stone fruit-driven natural-processed Geisha cup with an engaging, cleanly cordial-like fruit ferment suggestion throughout.

Notes: This coffee tied for the fifth-highest rating in a tasting of holiday coffees for Coffee Review‘s December 2018 tasting report. Produced by Rodolfo Huezo Pineda entirely of the Pacamara variety of Arabica. The Pacamara is a big-beaned hybrid of the Bourbon-related Pacas and the huge-beaned Maragogipe, a mutant of the ancient Typica variety. This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Speckled Ax is a roaster based in Portland, Maine, specializing in high-quality certified organic and small-lot coffees. The company roasts in a vintage wood-fired Petroncini roaster with the goal of highlighting each coffee’s best attributes. Visit www.speckledax.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A washed-process Pacamara cup that leads with bright stone fruit notes, balanced by bittersweet citrus zest and aromatic wood.

Notes: This coffee earned the highest rating in a tasting of holiday coffees for Coffee Review‘s December 2018 tasting report. Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also spelled Geisha). With its elegantly elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is a particularly refined presentation of the Gesha variety developed by boutique green coffee exporter/importer Ninety Plus Coffee and processed by its proprietary ""hot fermentation"" method. Bar Nine, founded in 2013, describes itself as a company of empathetic, impassioned and hard-working individuals who care about delivering a consistently memorable coffee experience, whether in its Bar Nine Los Angeles café, or in a home or business setting.  Visit www.barnine.us for more information.

Blind Assessment: Delicately fruit-toned, richly cocoa-driven. Ripe strawberry, dark chocolate,  almond, freesia-like flowers, a hint of wine barrel in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with crisp, high-toned acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. The flavor-saturated finish sustains all of the aroma and flavor notes promised by the cup.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 9 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a rare variety of Arabica that is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was produced in Kona and is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500 foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This rare coffee is only available on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A bright, juicy, berry-toned Hawaii cup from the extremely rare tree variety Pointu Laurina, worth a splurge for its clean fruit and sweet, cocoa-laden richness.

Blind Assessment: Deeply sweet, richly savory. Dark chocolate, pistachio, red currant jam, honeysuckle, a hint of marjoram in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweetly savory structure with elegant, lilting acidity; lush, syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant finish consolidates to notes of dark chocolate and red currant, with undertones of crisp marjoram.
Notes: Despite challenges ranging from contested government coffee policy and urban encroachment on prime coffee lands to chronically unstable weather, Kenya continues to produce some of the world’s most elegant and distinctive coffees. This particular sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading.

Blind Assessment: Fruit-forward, richly chocolaty. Raspberry coulis, chocolate fudge, brandy, cedar, mace in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with gentle, rounded acidity; full, creamy mouthfeel. Fruit-toned finish: think berries enveloped in chocolate, with a hint of mace in the long.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Like most southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee was produced by villagers on small garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

The Bottom Line: A playful, unrestrained fruit bomb of a coffee, rich with berry and fudgy chocolate notes throughout.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Rich, chocolaty, sweetly tart. Dark chocolate, peach, Szechuan peppercorn, orange zest, myrrh in aroma and small cup. Smooth, satiny mouthfeel; resonant, chocolaty finish. In three parts milk, notes of Szechuan peppercorn and dark chocolate harmonize sweetly, with undercurrents of peach and myrrh.

Notes: A blend of coffees from Ethiopia (natural-processed), Colombia and Kenya.

The Bottom Line: An espresso blend in which spice notes — in particular, a peppery element reminiscent of sweet Szechuan peppercorns — figure prominently and are in harmonious balance with the rich sweetness of the coffee, both in the straight shot and in milk.

Blind Assessment: Spice-toned, complex, richly bittersweet. Blackberry, dark chocolate, blood orange zest, ginger blossom, oak in aroma and cup. Bittersweet in structure with bright, high-toned acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant finish is redolent with notes of cocoa-toned blackberry and spicy ginger blossom.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 26 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Produced by César Fernandez of El Cielito farm entirely of the Parainema variety of Arabica, a hybrid developed by the Honduran Coffee Institute for its resistance to drought and disease. This is a wet-processed or washed coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. An integral part of New York’s coffee renaissance, Brooklyn-based Café Grumpy opened its first café in 2005 and has since expanded to eight locations in New York, including a roasting facility, and one in Miami.

Blind Assessment: High-toned, balanced, crisply sweet. Apricot, tangerine zest, dark chocolate, honey, rhododendron in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with juicy, bright acidity; buoyant, syrupy mouthfeel. The rich finish is centered around notes of dark chocolate and tangerine zest, with vanilla-toned florals.

Notes: Produced entirely from trees of Bourbon-related varieties of Arabica by members of the SOPACDI coop. Located overlooking Lake Kivu, on the opposite side of the lake from Rwanda, this rapidly growing cooperative now has nearly 6,000 members and apparently is succeeding in its goal to help heal wounds left by the latest in eastern Congo’s seemingly endless string of horrific rebellions and civil wars. A wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. This coffee is certified organically grown and certified fair trade, meaning it was purchased at no less than a minimum price determined by the certifying agency to be economically sustainable for the farmers. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums.

Notes: Produced by Jose Oliveira entirely of the Catuai variety of Arabica, and processed by the pulped natural method, meaning that the outer skin of the coffee fruit is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but all or some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin.

Notes: Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional indigenous varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Yirgacheffe coffees like this one processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying) typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity with a particular emphasis on floral notes.

Blind Assessment: Wild, unruly, utterly brilliant and original. Intensely and intricately floral-toned: opulent lily through delicate violet with a shifting bouquet of possibilities between. At the heart of aroma and flavor is a cidery, brandyish compote of fruit--apple, passion fruit, lychee--rounded by a fine, cocoa-toned chocolate. The structure is shifty, simultaneously sweet, crisply bitterish and tart, the mouthfeel plump and syrupy. The finish rings on with continuing layers of fruit, flowers, cocoa and coconut.   
Notes: The intensity and complexity of this extraordinary coffee are owing both to tree variety and processing method. The variety is the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also spelled Geisha). With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffee varieties. Joseph Brodsky and his colleagues processed this Gesha at Ninety Plus Gesha Estates in Panama using a refined and innovative processing procedure involving fermenting the whole, freshly-picked coffee fruit at high temperatures using a special yeast strain before drying it, still in the whole fruit. Bird Rock Coffee Roasters is a retailer and wholesaler focused on organic and socially responsible coffees; it was awarded the “2012 Micro-Roaster of the Year” title by Roast Magazine. Visit www.birdrockcoffee.com or call 858-551-1707 for more information.
The Bottom Line: The grand floral and cocoa complexity of the Gesha variety is amplified here by an innovative processing method that turns mouthfeel big and buoyant and the fruit lush, intense and giddily brandy-toned.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as an instant or soluble coffee at proportions of 5 grams of instant coffee powder mixed with 8.5 ounces (250 ml) of hot water. Richly sweet, fruit-toned. Strawberry, honey, cedar, hibiscus, hazelnut in aroma and cup. Bittersweet structure with tart-leaning acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. The crisp finish centers around strawberry and hazelnut notes.

This coffee was sourced and roasted by Cirque Coffee in Tulsa, Oklahoma and solubilized and packaged as an instant by Voilá Coffee in Bend, Oregon.

Blind Assessment: Deep, chocolaty, cleanly fruit-toned. Dark chocolate, cedar, black cherry, magnolia, molasses in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with gentle, rounded acidity. Consolidates to resonant chocolate and cherry in the finish.
Notes: The components of this blend are certified organically grown and Fair Trade certified, meaning they were purchased from small-holding farmers at a “fair” or economically sustainable price. This version of the ancient Mocha-Java blend combines a traditionally processed, wet-hulled Sumatra in place of the original Java and replaces the Yemen Mocha with a similar “natural” or dried-in-the-fruit coffee from Ethiopia. One of the country’s pioneering socially and environmentally progressive roasters, Thanksgiving aimed to combine coffee quality with social and environmental responsibility many years before the latter preoccupations became fashionable.

Blind Assessment: Nuanced, layered, richly sweet-savory. Fine musk, wisteria-like flowers, dark chocolate, pipe tobacco, black cherry in aroma and cup. Balanced sweet-tart-savory structure with juicy, vibrant acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish is resonant, flavor-saturated, and impressively long.
Notes: This coffee was grown by indigenous Batak people, who have been involved in coffee production since the practice was brought to Sumatra by the Dutch in the late 19th century. Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are admired for their complex aromatic wood and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type, developed and imported by Olam Specialty Coffee. Founded by roaster Heather Brisson-Lutz in 2018, Origin Coffee Roasters highlights the origin of each carefully selected coffee with a roast profile that befits the specific characteristics of the green. Visit www.origincoffeemaui.com for more information.

Blind Assessment: Crisp, high-toned, richly sweet. Strawberry, cocoa powder, honeysuckle, cedar, cashew butter in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with bright acidity; crisp, satiny mouthfeel. The finish consolidates to cocoa and honeysuckle with a throughline of rich, cedar-like aromatic wood.
Notes: Produced by the Muñoz family at La Meseta-Guamera farm from trees of the Caturra, Castillo and Colombia varieties of Arabica. This is a honey-processed coffee, which means that the outer skin is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. Founded by roaster Heather Brisson-Lutz in 2018, Origin Coffee Roasters highlights the origin of each carefully selected coffee with a roast profile that supports the specific characteristics of the green bean. Visit www.origincoffeemaui.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A deeply sweet, subtly fruit-toned cup processed by the honey method, unusual for coffees from Colombia.

Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 5 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. This coffee also earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees from New England roasters for Coffee Review’s February 2019 tasting report. Produced entirely from trees of the Bourbon variety of Arabica, this is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying.  This particular sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans.

Blind Assessment: Fruit-toned, delicately spicy. Dried strawberry, nutmeg, fresh-cut fir, reduction of balsamic vinegar, myrrh in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with brisk acidity; round, plump mouthfeel. The hint of sweet ferment throughout the profile is amplified in the resounding finish, which is both sweet and appealingly savory, with notes suggesting a richly pleasing balsamic vinegar reduction.
Notes: This coffee tied for the highest rating in a cupping of coffees from Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador for Coffee Review’s March 2019 tasting report. Produced by the Rodriguez family of Finca Alasitas entirely from the trees of the celebrated Geisha (also spelled Gesha) variety of Arabica. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. This is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

Blind Assessment: Crisply sweet, spice-toned. Candied pistachio, gardenia, cedar, sugar cane, apricot in aroma and cup. Bittersweet structure with round, gentle acidity; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The understated finish is driven by notes of nut brittle and spicy, deeply sweet flowers.
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador for Coffee Review’s March 2019 tasting report. Produced entirely from trees of the celebrated Geisha (also spelled Gesha) variety of Arabica. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Blues Brew Coffee is Taipei-based coffee roaster seeking the highest quality coffees for the enjoyment of global coffee-lovers. For more information, visit https://www.facebook.com/bluesbrewcoffee.
The Bottom Line: An ultra-sweet Peru Geisha cup resonating rich floral and deep nut tones throughout.

Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from Sumatra for Coffee Review’s April 2019 tasting report. Processed by the atypical (for Sumatra) honey method, in which the skin is removed from the coffee fruit immediately after picking, but the seeds or beans are dried with all or part of the sweet pulp, or fruit flesh, still adhering to them.

Blind Assessment: Sweetly pungent, earthy. Moist, fresh-fallen leaves, orange zest, fresh-cut pine, cocoa, lily in aroma and cup. Richly tart in structure, with a savory edge. Light but buoyant mouthfeel. The finish consolidates around cocoa, orange and a deep, lily-like floral note. 
Notes: This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from Sumatra for Coffee Review’s April 2019 tasting report. Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” Produced by the Ketiara Cooperative, the only women-led cooperative in Indonesia, with 867 small-holding members. Certified at origin as fair-trade (by Fairtrade International) and organically grown, but not so labeled. Barrington Coffee is an artisan roaster dedicated to elite coffees, fresh delivery and roasting that foregrounds the coffee and not the roast. Visit www.barringtoncoffee.com or call 800-528-0998 for more information.
The Bottom Line: Attractive choice for lovers of the traditional Sumatra wet-hulled profile: earthy, pungent, yet bright, offering bonus satisfaction for supporters of progressive, women-led cooperatives.

Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type, branded Tano Batak by the exporters, Olam specialty Coffee and produced in the admired Lintong region south of Lake Toba. Peach Coffee Roasters is an Atlanta, Georgia-based specialty roaster. Visit www.peachcoffeeroasters.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: Bright and vivacious, yet resonantly deep: a Sumatra for all seasons.

Blind Assessment: Brightly sweet, deeply pungent. Fine musk, black currant, baker’s chocolate, violet, oak in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with juicy acidity; crisp, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. The flavor-saturated finish consolidates around musk and currant notes with a hint of baker’s chocolate.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

The Bottom Line: A rich-toned, resonant, cleanly fruity natural-processed Ethiopia cup with delicate florals and sweet musky notes throughout.

Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 25 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Produced at Cerro Las Ranas farm from trees of the Bourbon variety of Arabica. Processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin.

Blind Assessment: Very sweetly tart, floral-prominent and rich-toned. Lemon custard, red currant jam, tea rose, maple syrup and dried coconut in aroma and cup. Delightfully crisp and tart, though cohesively resonant in structure; very lightly though buoyantly syrupy in mouthfeel. The finish is pert and satisfying, with a lingering sweet crispness and a long aromatic trajectory.

Notes: Despite grower discontent and urban encroachment on prime coffee lands, Kenya continues to produce some of the world’s most elegant and distinctive coffees.

Blind Assessment: Sweetly tart, spice-toned. Dried black cherry, lantana, pipe tobacco, allspice, cedar in aroma and cup. Tart-leaning structure with brisk acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. In the quiet, gently drying finish, fruit and florals recede and savory/spice notes, specifically pipe tobacco and cedar, are amplified.
Notes: This nano-lot, imported by Paradise Coffee, represents a coffee produced in the Sabah state of Malaysia, across the South China Sea from mainland Malaysia, on the island of Borneo. Malaysian coffee is typically associated with the Robusta and Liberica species, not the Arabica varieties that are most prominent in specialty coffee, making this the first Malaysia-grown Arabica coffee ever to be roasted and sold outside of that country. It is a mix of varieties of Arabica and is processed by the double-washed method. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information. 
The Bottom Line: The first coffee from Malaysian Borneo to be roasted for retail consumers in the U.S. and a promising new project in a region not yet known for specialty coffee.

Blind Assessment: Deeply sweet, richly drying, complexly sweet-savory. Nutella, sumac, oak, clove, loquat, hop blossom in aroma and cup.

Balanced, sweet-tart-savory in structure with vibrant, juicy acidity; buoyant, syrupy mouthfeel. Crisp, resonant finish with raspberry, brandy and hops carrying into the long.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet, cocoa- and fruit-toned. Concord grape, cocoa nib, sandalwood, maple syrup, lilac in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with bright, juicy acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. Resonant, flavor-saturated finish that highlights fruit and cocoa tones.

Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 14 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha). With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. Processed by the dried-in-the-fruit or natural method. Small Eyes Café is a small, family-owned coffee shop in Yilan, Taiwan, specializing in artisanally roasted specialty coffee and homemade desserts.

Notes: Produced by farmer Tesfaye Bekele from largely indigenous varieties of Arabica long grown in the Guji area, about 40 kilometers southeast of the famous Yirgacheffe region.

Notes: Produced from trees of local strains of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica.

Blind Assessment: Shifting, original, startling in its giddy intricacy. Winey pine (think retsina wine), cocoa powder, green apple, Concord grape, ginger blossom, much more in aroma and cup. Sweetly and delicately pungent in structure. Lightly syrupy and almost effervescently buoyant in mouthfeel. The winey pine character and a floral sweetness carry persuasively into a crisp finish.

Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 3 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Comprised entirely of beans from the rare Sudan Rume, a presumably very old variety of Arabica originally selected from wild trees growing on the Boma Plateau of Sudan, close to the border with Ethiopia. Processed by the dried-in-the-fruit or natural method. Produced by Rigoberto Herrera at Granja La Esperanza in Colombia, an innovative producer that specializes in impressive and innovative work with unusual cultivars of Arabica.

Notes: Until 2015, Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros, the governing body of Colombian Coffee, only allowed exports of washed coffees. This coffee is processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin.

Pungent, sweet-tart in structure, with a profound savory bottom. The mouthfeel is not particularly full, but smooth, satiny. Nothing is lost in a flavor-saturated finish.
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from Sumatra for Coffee Review’s April 2019 tasting report. Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” Gracenote Coffee is an espresso bar and roastery in Boston, Massachusetts.

Blind Assessment: Cocoa- and mango-toned, quietly zesty. Baker’s chocolate, mango, sandalwood, almond nougat, freesia-like flowers in aroma and cup.

Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from Sumatra for Coffee Review’s April 2019 tasting report.

Blind Assessment: Soft, balanced: cocoa and nuts. Baking chocolate, tangerine zest, nut (hazelnut, pistachio), fresh-cut pine in aroma and cup. Delicately brisk in structure; light though silky mouthfeel. Finish is resonant but drying, consolidating around unsweetened chocolate and nut.
Notes: This coffee was produced by the ASOPCAFA small producer association, a cooperative founded in 2013. It is a wet-processed, or washed, coffee, meaning that the skin and fruit pulp were removed or “washed” from the beans before they were dried. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums. Visit www.jbccoffeeroasters.com or call 608-256-5282 for more information.  
The Bottom Line: Crisp, briskly dry yet sweet; delicately chocolate- and nut-toned.

Blind Assessment: Round, layered, sweet-savory, understated but original. Walnut, cocoa powder, maple syrup, hints of pear and rum in aroma and cup. Softly brisk in structure; syrupy and full in mouthfeel. Flavor consolidates around walnut and maple syrup in a gently drying finish. 
Notes: Burundi is a small, landlocked country in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. Most coffee is grown in the mountains of the north, bordering Rwanda. Benefiting from ideal growing conditions and large plantings of local strains of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica, Burundi coffees have developed an excellent and growing reputation. Processed by the dry or “natural” method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or ""washed"" coffees. The company name Amavida combines the Spanish words for love and life, reflecting Amavida’s multifaceted commitment to fairness and fine coffee. For further information visit www.amavida.com or call 850-213-1965.
The Bottom Line: A quietly original coffee: big-bodied, low-toned, crisply sweet-savory.

Blind Assessment: Vibrant, juicy, brightly fruit-toned and spicily floral. Wild strawberry, honey, dried gardenia, pistachio butter, pink peppercorn in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with crisp, fresh acidity; viscous, lively mouthfeel. The finish amplifies rich floral and fruit with support from deep spice and earthy honey suggestions.
Notes: This coffee tied for the highest rating in a cupping of Hawai’i-grown coffees for Coffee Review’s May 2019 tasting report. This Ka’u coffee, comprised mostly of the Typica and Caturra varieties of Arabica, was processed using an unusual sequence of procedures. It was first fermented in the whole fruit with wine yeasts added to the tank, then dried in the whole fruit, making it, in effect, a fermented natural. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information. 
The Bottom Line: Adventures in wine yeast: Two of Hawai’i’s (and the world’s) most common coffee varieties are elevated by an experimental fermentation method that results in a beverage that evokes Champagne — fruity but dry, not effervescent, but exceptionally vibrant.

Blind Assessment: Floral and sweetly herbaceous with richly framed depth. Jasmine, spearmint, chocolate, watermelon, fine musk in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet structure with vibrant, juicy acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant, flavor-saturated finish centers around chocolate and jasmine with musk undertones.
Notes: This coffee tied for the highest rating in a cupping of Hawai’i-grown coffees for Coffee Review’s May 2019 tasting report. Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) by Greg and Susy Stille at Monarch Coffee Estate. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Geisha/Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This version was processed by the traditional wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. Founded in 1995 by Brooke McDonnell and Helen Russell, Equator Coffees operates retail stores in the bay area and provides coffee to hundreds of wholesale accounts. Equator has been a certified B-Corp since 2011, and its commitment to a sustainable, transparent approach spans more than two decades. Visit www.equatorcoffees.com or call 800-809-7687 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A deep, nuanced Gesha, excitingly original with high-toned herb notes, low-toned, almost candy-sweet fruit, and rich, spice-toned florals.

Blind Assessment: Sweetly spice-toned, richly chocolaty. Salted chocolate, hop flowers, Concord grape, ginger, a hint of aged grappa in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory structure with fruit-forward, wine-toned acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish leads with Concord grape and ginger in the short, followed by hops in the long, all bound by a throughline of savory-sweet chocolate and aged grappa.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 30 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019.  This coffee also tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of Hawai’i-grown coffees for Coffee Review’s May 2019 tasting report. Produced entirely of the Caturra variety of Arabica by Accidental Coffee Farm in Glenwood, Hawai’i at an altitude of 2,000 feet in the Puna District of the Big Island. Processed by the Kenya-style double-washed method, then further conditioned using an experimental barrel-aging treatment in local Kuleana rum barrels. Big Island Coffee is an award-winning coffee roaster and coffee farm operated with hands-on passion by Kelleigh Stewart and Brandon von Damitz. Visit www.bigislandcoffeeroasters.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A fascinating sensory experience of a coffee aged in rum barrels: a recombinant mashup of musky fruit notes, sweet ferment, spicy florals, and chocolate with a salty edge.

Blind Assessment: Rich-toned, deeply sweet. Black cherry, magnolia, fresh-cut cedar, maple syrup, a hint of thyme in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with round, gentle acidity; lush, syrupy mouthfeel. Resonant finish that centers around notes of black cherry and cedar.
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of Hawai’i-grown coffees for Coffee Review’s May 2019 tasting report. Produced entirely of the Typica variety of Arabica and processed by the traditional wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. This sample also consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Big Island Coffee is an award-winning coffee roaster and coffee farm operated with hands-on passion by Kelleigh Stewart and Brandon von Damitz. Visit www.bigislandcoffeeroasters.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: The classically delicate, subtle Kona Typica profile is enhanced by the careful medium roast, as well as by the selection of peaberries only.

Blind Assessment: Classic, balanced, rich-toned. Honeysuckle, red currant, toffee, dried coconut, mango in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart in structure with bright acidity; velvety-smooth mouthfeel. The finish consolidates to toffee-toned red currant in the short and coconut in the long.
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of Hawai’i-grown coffees for Coffee Review’s May 2019 tasting report. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500 foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced entirely from trees of the distinguished SL-28 variety of Arabica, the most celebrated of the Bourbon-derived tree varieties responsible for Kenya’s finest coffees. This SL-28 was grown at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm and processed with the ferment step conducted “dry” (no water added to the tank) using a commercial yeast. It is a limited-edition coffee only available for sale through the allocation list on the Hula Daddy website. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information. 
The Bottom Line: A classic SL-28 cup, juicy-sweet with leading notes of red fruit and spice-toned sweet florals, supported by suggestions of buttery toffee.

Sweetly tart structure with bright acidity; lightly satiny mouthfeel. The rich, long finish is flavor-saturated, consolidating to cocoa, fresh tobacco and marjoram.
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of Hawai’i-grown coffees for Coffee Review’s May 2019 tasting report. Comprised entirely of the Kona Typica variety of Arabica and sourced by Isla Custom Coffees (a sister company of Rusty’s Hawaiian) from various Ka’u farms. Processed by the natural method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed coffees. Nine Point Coffee is a Taipei-based specialty roaster and cafe. For more information, visit https://m.facebook.com/NINEPOINTCOFFEE/?locale2=zh_TW.
The Bottom Line: An engaging natural-processed Ka’u coffee, fruit-driven, with a foundation of pipe tobacco and cocoa notes.

Blind Assessment: Bright, crisply sweet-tart. Peach, honeysuckle, cinnamon, cedar, cacao nib in aroma and cup. Richly sweet, high-toned structure with citrusy acidity; crisp, silky mouthfeel. Peach and honeysuckle carry the short finish, while cocoa-toned cedar resurfaces in the long. 
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 16 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. This coffee also tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of Hawai’i-grown coffees for Coffee Review’s May 2019 tasting report. Produced by Gerry Ross and Janet Simpson at Kupa’a Farms entirely of the Orange Bourbon variety of Arabica, and processed by the wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. Founded by roaster Heather Brisson-Lutz in 2018, Origin Coffee Roasters highlights the origin of each carefully selected coffee with a roast profile that highlights the specific characteristics of the green. Visit www.origincoffeemaui.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A window into the great potential of higher-grown, cool-climate Maui coffee: bright but balanced, sweet-toned, and subtly nuanced. Grown in Kula, an agricultural zone on the western-facing slopes of Mount Haleakala and source of most of the island’s locally grown fruits and vegetables.

Blind Assessment: Crisply sweet, fruit- and spice-toned. Apricot, oak, baker’s chocolate, freesia, sandalwood in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet structure with a tart lift and lively acidity; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The finish centers around crisp stone fruit and aromatic wood notes, with a hint of spicy flowers underneath.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of Hawai’i-grown coffees for Coffee Review’s May 2019 tasting report. Ka’u is an emerging Hawai’i coffee-growing district centered approximately 30 miles southeast of the famous Kona region. This 100% Ka’u coffee was developed by Lorie Obra of Rusty’s, one of Ka’u’s best-known and most celebrated farms. Produced from trees of the traditional Typica variety and processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. Visit www.rustyshawaiian.com or call 808-928-8916 for more information.
The Bottom Line: Richly floral and cleanly fruit-toned, an impressive and increasingly familiar style of natural- and honey-processed coffee from Ka’u producers.

Sweetly savory in structure with round, gentle acidity; crisp, satiny mouthfeel. The finish is characterized by dried fruit and mixed baking spices animating fresh-cut aromatic wood. 
Notes: This coffee earned the fourth-highest rating in a cupping of Hawai’i-grown coffees for Coffee Review’s May 2019 tasting report.

Greenwell Farms is one of the oldest coffee farms and mills in Kona, still owned and operated on a daily basis by Tom Greenwell, a direct descendent of the founders.

Visit www.greenwellfarms.com or call 1-888-592-5662 for more info.
The Bottom Line: An opportunity to taste one of the world’s rarest coffees, a hybrid that exemplifies the persistence and ingenuity of coffee scientists.

Blind Assessment: High-toned sweetness, crisply tart, pleasantly salty-edged. Dried apricot, tamarind, salted chocolate, cedar, magnolia in aroma and cup.

BeanFruit Coffee Coffee Company is a small coffee-roasting company located in the Jackson, Mississippi area, founded on a desire to provide freshly roasted coffee to the Jackson area and educate local consumers about great-tasting coffee. Visit www.beanfruit.com or call 601-624-2605 for more information.
The Bottom Line: An attractively tart and savory honey-processed coffee. Try it with salty morning dishes, which should develop its subtle, complementary sweetness.

Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying.

Blind Assessment: Very sweet, richly perfumed, wood-framed. Pipe-tobacco, lychee fruit, spice box, freesia-like flowers, amber and musk in aroma and cup. Richly, densely composed structure, crisply tart acidity. Impressively syrupy-smooth mouthfeel. The finish consolidates pleasantly into a slightly drying though rich-toned, spicy tobacco.
Notes: Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea Arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Yemen coffee is still grown from ancient heirloom cultivars of arabica on stone-walled terraces ringing fortress-like mountaintop villages. All Yemen coffees are natural-processed, or dried in the whole fruit. This particular Yemen may owe its striking aromatics to ancient tree varieties, but its clean elegance is most likely owing to the efforts of exporter Rayyan Mill in the capital of Sana’a, which has worked with farmers to improve picturesque but often haphazard harvesting and drying procedures. Baba Java is a specialty roaster and cafe retailer located in Hoover Alabama, who strives to provide the best coffee experience at every step. Visit www.babajavacoffee.com or call 205-777-5984 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A complex and engaging rendition of the characteristically richly spicy, tobacco-toned, floral-fruity Yemen profile.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Richly sweet, fruit-toned and chocolaty. Dark chocolate, dried cherry, fresh-cut fir, almond blossom, molasses in aroma and small cup. Full, satiny-smooth mouthfeel; flavor-saturated finish driven by chocolate and stone fruit notes. This blend sings in milk, elevating notes of both cherry and chocolate in lasting vibrancy.
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of “classic” espresso blends for Coffee Review’s June 2019 tasting report. A blend of both washed and natural-processed coffees from Central and South America. This coffee is certified organically grown and certified fair trade, the latter meaning it was purchased at no less than a minimum price determined by the certifying agency to be economically sustainable for the farmers. Established in 2010, Red Rooster is an organic-certified micro-roaster focusing on socially conscious coffee, high-quality coffee. Visit redroostercoffee.com or call 540-745-7338 for more information.
The Bottom Line: Suggests classic in its fusion of fruit and chocolate, but the inclusion of a natural-processed Central America coffee in the blend adds a newer-style, high-toned fruit note that is especially pretty in milk.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as an instant or soluble coffee at proportions of one cube of instant coffee mixed with 8.5 ounces (250 ml) of hot water. Delicately sweet-savory.

Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region.

Deeply sweet-toned in structure with lively, juicy acidity; syrupy mouthfeel. The finish is long and satisfying: flavor-saturated, floral-, chocolate- and fruit-toned, harmoniously balanced.

This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Acatenango is the name of a coffee-growing municipality as well as a famous volcano overlooking the Antigua Valley of Guatemala. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.
The Bottom Line: A friendly, cocoa- and nut-toned Guatemala espresso, both as straight shot and in cappuccino-scaled milk.

Blind Assessment: A complex and overwhelming aromatic immersion. Pink bubblegum, winter spices, salted fudge, candied ginger, elderflower, herbal liqueur (yellow chartreuse?) in aroma and cup. The structure is dramatic: basic tastes are all disconcertingly intense, including sweet, salt and savory, yet they all somehow layer and satisfy. Very full and syrupy mouthfeel with a spicy drying edge. The finish is resonant, slightly bittersweet though chocolaty and rich.
Notes: This coffee is a collaboration between brothers Michael Johnson of JBC Coffee Roasters and Joseph Brodsky of the Panama producer Ninety Plus Coffee. It was produced entirely from trees of the celebrated Gesha variety of Arabica, and processed by an unconventional, proprietary variation of the wet method in which the whole coffee fruit is subjected to fermentation and washing before drying. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums. Visit www.jbccoffeeroasters.com or call 608-256-5282 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A coffee that in its wild, unruly intensity and intriguing aromatic drama challenges the boundaries of what coffee is and can be.

Blind Assessment: Elaborate, vibrant, exhilarating. Dark chocolate truffle, strawberry guava, candied ginger, lilac, myrrh in aroma and cup. Crisply sweet-tart structure with bright, succulent acidity; very syrupy mouthfeel. The finish is zesty in the short and cocoa- and floral-toned in the long.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 11 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Produced at La Palma Y El Tucan entirely from trees of the Sidra variety of Arabica, a hybrid of the old and respected varieties Red Bourbon and Typica. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

Visit www.birdrockcoffee.com or call 858-551-1707 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A uniquely compelling coffee that is, at turns, spicy, floral, chocolaty and fruit-toned, yet in the end harmonious and complete.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Exquisitely aromatic: high-toned, savory and impossibly floral. Toffee, dried black currant, myrrh, lavender, fine musk in aroma and small cup. Plush, syrupy mouthfeel; big, complex finish that is equal parts sweet and savory. In cappuccino-scaled milk, a whole new mid-palate is created, something akin to a mushroom custard.

Notes: Produced by the Kenya Coffee Research Institute at its demonstration Rukera Farm from trees of the SL28, SL34, K7, Ruiru 11 & Batian varieties of Arabica and processed by the wet, or washed, method.

Blind Assessment: High-toned, fruity, deeply savory. Cocoa nib, plum sauce, brown sugar, sumac, freesia in aroma and cup. Round and deep, richly sweet-savory structure; full, chewy mouthfeel. The finish resolves with a simple yet compelling sweet and tart resonance.
Notes: Burundi is a small, landlocked country in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. Most coffee is grown in the mountains of the north, bordering Rwanda. Benefiting from ideal growing conditions and large plantings of local strains of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica, Burundi coffees have developed an excellent and growing reputation. Processed by the dry or “natural” method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Flight Coffee Co. is a coffee-loving, quality-focused roasting company based in Bedford, New Hampshire.Visit www.flightcoffeeco.com or call 603-836-6228 for more information.
The Bottom Line: An attractively bright and fruit-centered coffee with unique and inviting savory elements.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Cocoa-toned, deeply sweet. Cocoa powder, date, cedar, apricot, blood orange zest in aroma and small cup. Big, creamy mouthfeel; the finish is redolent of cocoa and citrus zest. In cappucino-scaled milk, cocoa tones are amplified, as are notes of stone fruit and citrus.
Notes: Produced by Verónica Lantan Vela de Acajabon at Finca El General from trees of the Typica and Caturra varieties of Arabica. This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Acatenango is the name of a coffee-growing municipality as well as a famous volcano overlooking the Antigua Valley of Guatemala. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

The Bottom Line: A satisfying Guatemala espresso: balanced, with notes of stone fruit and cocoa. Especially attractive in the milk shot.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Spice-toned, fruit-forward. Dried raspberry, cinnamon, dark chocolate, almond butter, narcissus in aroma and small cup. Crisp, satiny texture; resonant, flavor-saturated finish. In three parts milk, balanced and chocolaty, with lingering spice notes.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 21 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. This coffee also tied for the highest rating in a tasting of “classic” espresso blends for Coffee Review’s June 2019 tasting report. A blend of coffees including a wet-processed Red Bourbon variety of Arabica from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and natural-processed Ethiopia. This coffee is certified organically grown and certified fair trade, the latter meaning it was purchased at no less than a minimum price determined by the certifying agency to be economically sustainable for the farmers. The company name Amavida combines the Spanish words for love and life, reflecting Amavida’s multifaceted commitment to fairness and fine coffee. For further information visit www.amavida.com or call 850-213-1965.
The Bottom Line: A juicy, balanced espresso blend, both in the straight shot—where berry notes predominate—and in milk—where chocolate frames the fruit and florals.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Deeply chocolaty, richly floral. Chocolate fudge, lilac, peach, fresh-cut cedar, hazelnut butter in aroma and small cup. Crisp, satiny-smooth mouthfeel; the deep, long, resonant finish maintains all of the aroma and flavor notes from the cup. Also profoundly satisfying in three parts milk, with chocolate and florals in a slow dance and fruit returning to the surface in the long finish.
Notes: This coffee tied for the highest rating in a tasting of “classic” espresso blends for Coffee Review’s June 2019 tasting report. A single-origin blend of coffees from various Inza smallholder farmers in Colombia and comprised of the Castillo, Caturra and Colombia varieties of Arabica. Visit www.follycoffee.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: An unusually successful “melange” coffee in which the same blend of green beans is roasted both darker and lighter, then combined. This version hits all of the notes associated with a complete, classic espresso: rich, resounding, chocolaty, floral and fruit-toned.

Blind Assessment: Deeply sweet, elegantly rich. Mulberry, sandalwood, tangerine zest, jasmine, baking spices in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart in structure with high-toned, juicy acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The seemingly infinite finish fulfills the promise of the cup, leading with deep berry and citrus zest, rounding to floral-toned spice.
Notes: Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Boulder, Colorado-based Dragonfly Coffee was named 2019 Micro-Roaster of the Year by Roast magazine. Visit dragonflycoffeeroasters.com or call 303-579-2154 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A complex, nuanced expression of a natural-processed Yirgacheffe coffee: fruit-forward, balanced, juicy and multi-layered — the fruit-centered genius of a natural conveyed with the completeness and inevitability of a classic.

Structure is deeply sweet-savory, with juicy acidity; gently drying, syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant finish is crisp and rich: cocoa, tobacco, florals and citrus zest carry into the long.

Blind Assessment: Vibrant, high-toned, exhilarating. Floral medley (lavender, rose, wisteria), grapefruit zest, ripe passion fruit, cocoa, a hint of ginger in aroma and cup. Sweetly and brilliantly bright in structure; lightly syrupy in mouthfeel. Flavors consolidate but ring on in a long, resonantly layered finish.

Produced from trees of the still rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also spelled Gesha), and processed by the wet or washed method (fruit is removed from the beans before they are dried). Geisha was planted on the Granja La Esperanza farms as part of a ten-year project to improve coffee quality and to introduce new botanical varietals to Colombia; Cerro Azul is one of those farms. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and chocolate cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. modcup coffee, founded in 2013, focuses on fresh roasting and distinctive natural-processed coffees.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet, fruit-forward. Dried peach, baker’s chocolate, jasmine, cedar, molasses in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with bright, juicy acidity; crisp, satiny mouthfeel. Long, lingering finish that centers around dried peach and chocolate notes, supported by cedar-like wood.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are produced from traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. It was processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. Pro Aroma Enterprise Coffee Co., Ltd. is a Taiwan-based specialty coffee company. For more information, visit proaroma.weebly.com or email [email protected]
The Bottom Line: Deep, floral and cleanly fruit-toned, with prominent notes of dried stone fruit, spicy florals, and rich aromatic wood.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet, fruit- and floral-toned. Blueberry, narcissus, agave syrup, sandalwood, dark chocolate in aroma and cup. Sweet in structure with gentle, round acidity; plushly syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant finish leads with notes of blueberry and narcissus in the short, rounding to aromatic wood-framed chocolate in the long.
Notes: The cup profile of this coffee owes its originality to a complex, overlapping set of influences. First, tree variety: It was produced from distinctive-tasting indigenous varieties grown only in southern Ethiopia. Second, processing method: It is a “natural” or dry-processed coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is often sweeter and deeper-toned than profiles associated with the more typical wet or “washed” process in which the soft fruit residue is removed before drying. Finally, the beans were exposed to cultured strains of bacteria extracted from the excrement of the civet cat, making this a laboratory version of the famous kopi luwak, the coffee passed through the intestines of a civet cat or luwak. Good Chance Biotechnology., Ltd. is a Taiwan-based specialty coffee company. For more information, visit http://www.magiccat.pro/ or email [email protected]
The Bottom Line: A sweet-toned natural Ethiopia cup that supplements ripe berry notes and dark chocolate with inviting hints of rich sandalwood.

Blind Assessment: Lavish, captivatingly complex, deeply savory-sweet. Candycap mushroom, lilac, dark chocolate, dried coconut, frankincense in aroma and cup. Structurally, the savory component, which is typically an undertone, occupies the top of the aromatic and flavor range, with deep sweetness (fruit, florals) underneath. The mouthfeel is lively and richly syrupy. The seemingly eternal finish is a quiet mirror of the cup.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 2 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Produced by the Kenya Coffee Research Institute at its demonstration Rukera Farm from trees of the SL28, SL34, K7, Ruiru 11 & Batian varieties of Arabica and processed by the wet, or washed, method.

Blind Assessment: A deep sweetness and considerable complexity resonate impressively inside a bitter-savory structure. Hints of blueberry and guava, spearmint, cocoa, rose, a hint of clove in aroma and cup. Fully, syrupy mouthfeel. Flavor carries persuasively into a rich though bittersweet finish.
Notes:  This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a tasting of El Salvador coffees for Coffee Review’s August 2019 tasting report. Produced from trees of the much admired, bold-bean Pacamara variety of Arabica, a cross between the giant-beaned Maragogipe variety and Pacas, a selection of the heirloom Bourbon, by José Flores at his farm El Trompillo. Processed by the natural method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. A prize winner in the 2019 Chalatenango Best Cup competition organized by importer Cafe Imports designed to promote quality practices among local producers. Duluth Coffee is a cafe and wholesale specialty roaster founded in 2012 in downtown Duluth, Minnesota by Eric Faust. Visit www.duluthcoffeecompany.com for further information.

 
The Bottom Line: Almost two coffees, one dominated by a bracing bitter-leaning structure, the other sweet and complexly aromatic. Enjoy it for its paradox and its particularly syrupy mouthfeel.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso produced as a ristretto 25ml (.85-ounce) shot using a Nespresso capsule espresso brewer with whole milk heated using a conventional steam wand. Distinctly chocolaty, gently and sweetly bright. Baker’s chocolate, sweet lemon zest, almond, rhododendron-like flowers, maple wood in aroma and small cup. Feathery, lightly buoyant mouthfeel; flavor consolidates but rings on in a balanced finish. Crisply sweet in three parts milk: sweet lemon and chocolate, floral hints.
Notes: This coffee took first place in the 2018 Rwanda Cup of Excellence competition. Cup of Excellence competitions are internationally juried contests for green coffees held around the coffee-growing world and are by far the most rigorous and prestigious of such events. This top prize-winner was produced by the Twumba washing station or wet mill in Nyaruyaga Village entirely from trees of Bourbon-related varieties. Difference Coffee aims to present only the finest of the world’s coffees as determined by green coffee competitions and other measures of distinction, tactfully roasted and presented in capsules compatible with Nespresso capsule brewing systems.

Blind Assessment: Complex, chocolaty, richly sweet. Dark chocolate, guava, butterscotch, honeysuckle, ginger blossom in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with high-toned acidity; crisp, syrupy mouthfeel. Long, resounding finish that carries over all the notes from the cup, in particular foregrounding guava and dark chocolate.
Notes: Produced by Ato Esmael and his friends and family at their estate farm in the Guji Zone of southern Ethiopia.

Blind Assessment: Subtly and sweetly intense: flowers and cocoa. Lavender, cocoa, honey, candied nut, lemon zest, much more in aroma and cup. Richly and sweetly pungent in structure; light though plush and satiny in mouthfeel. A quiet, layered finish consolidates around lemon and lavender. 
Notes: The celebrated Geisha (also spelled Gesha) variety of Arabica first came to the coffee world’s attention in Panama. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It was grown in western Ethiopia by farmers Adam and Rachel Overton and their indigenous Meanit culture collaborators from seed selected from wild trees of the Geisha variety in the nearby Gori Gesha forest. The Overtons auction their best lots every year; this lot was #11 in the 2019 auction. It is a wet-processed or washed version, in which the skin and pulp of the fruit is removed before the coffee is dried, resulting here in a particularly bright, high-toned up. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums. Visit www.jbccoffeeroasters.com or call 608-256-5282 for more information.
The Bottom Line: Exhilarating, bright, balmy: like drinking a spring day with a cocoa chaser.

Blind Assessment: Exceptionally high-toned, delicately fruit-centered, intricately balanced. Mulberry, coconut, sandalwood, dark chocolate, lilac in aroma and cup. Richly sweet in structure with balanced, juicy acidity; delicate but plush, mouth-filling texture. The finish is a gentle reminder of everything the cup offers, in particular mulberry, coconut, and lilac.

Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 20 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. This coffee also tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees of the Geisha/Gesha variety of Arabica for Coffee Review’s September 2019 tasting report. Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also spelled Gesha) at the Kalithea Estate. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Geisha/Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than the more familiar wet-processed profile. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.
The Bottom Line: An exquisitely balanced natural-processed Geisha with the deep, sweet complexity the type can offer without a hint of ferment: crisply sweet fruit top and bottom notes, along with rich florals and chocolate tones in the mid-palate, all enhanced by a whisper of sandalwood.

Blind Assessment: Impeccably floral and cocoa-toned with a savory throughline. Chocolate fudge, wisteria, Asian pear, hazelnut butter, white peppercorn in aroma and cup. Richly sweet-savory structure with floral acidity; velvety-smooth, viscous mouthfeel. The finish centers around spice-toned chocolate (think dark chocolate with peppercorns) and wisteria.
Notes: This coffee earned the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees of the Geisha/Gesha variety of Arabica for Coffee Review’s September 2019 tasting report. Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) grown on Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world. With its bold, boat-shaped beans and distinctive floral and crisply cocoa-toned cup, the Geisha/Gesha continues to be one of the world’s most celebrated and sought-after coffee varieties, and the Esmeralda versions remain among the most authentic. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting but before drying. Dragonfly Coffee is a Boulder, Colorado-based micro-roaster that produces high-quality coffees and supports worthy causes. Visit www.dragonflycoffeeroasters.com or call 303-579-2154 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Crisply and sweetly bright, exquisitely balanced. Tangerine zest, lavender, cocoa, cedar, fresh apricot in aroma and cup. Bright, delicate but juicy in structure; silky/satiny in mouthfeel. The quietly complex finish fades in the short but apricot and lavender revive in the long.

Notes: This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a cupping of coffees of the Geisha/Gesha variety of Arabica for Coffee Review’s September 2019 tasting report. Produced by Agricolo Geisha. With its elongated beans and distinctive floral- and cocoa-toned cup, the Geisha (also Gesha) variety continues to produce some of the world’s most striking coffees. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting but before drying.

Visit www.caffeluxxe.com or call 310-394-2222 for more information.
The Bottom Line: An impressively smooth, coherent structure supports a quietly pleasing set of Geisha aromatics. Should satisfy those who may find the full-on Panama Geisha fireworks a bit much but who still enjoy the distinctive character of this rare variety.

Notes: This coffee comes from the world’s largest private collection of rare coffee trees, Gonzalo Hernandez’s Coffea Diversa, Costa Rica. Cioiccie is a rare variety first collected in Jimma, Ethiopia in the 1950s. It differs in cup profile from many other celebrated Ethiopia varieties. This version was processed by the wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. Paradise Roasters specializes in microlot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Sweetly fruit-toned, accessibly fermenty. Raspberry coulis, dark chocolate, hop flowers, wine barrel, pink peppercorn in aroma and cup. Richly bittersweet in structure with a tangy acidity; crisp, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant finish is all fruit and chocolate enhanced by a quiet sweet ferment.
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees submitted by North American roasters in business for two or fewer years for Coffee Review’s October 2019 tasting report. Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Coffeebar is a radically inclusive Italian café experience based in Truckee, California with locations in Menlo Park, Squaw Valley and Redwood City, as well as a roastery in Reno, Nevada. While it was founded in 2010, Coffeebar only began roasting in-house in 2018. Visit www.coffeebar.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A natural-processed Ethiopia ideal for those who enjoy a restrained hint of fruit ferment, in this case suggesting a just-emptied wine barrel in a cool cellar.

Blind Assessment: Savory-sweet, richly aromatic. Red currant, hop flowers, lime zest, dark chocolate, cedar in aroma and cup. Savory-sweet structure with high-toned, juicy acidity; full, buttery mouthfeel. Cocoa-toned finish with notes of red currant and lime zest in the short, rounding to hop flowers in the long.
Notes: This coffee earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees submitted by North American roasters in business for two or fewer years for Coffee Review’s October 2019 tasting report. Processed by the meticulous Kenya variation on the traditional wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. Visit www.stereocoffeeroasters.com or email [email protected] for more information.
The Bottom Line: A savory-leaning yet deeply sweet Kenya coffee with the distinct red and black currant notes characteristic of the origin, bittersweet florals and a lively citrus.

Blind Assessment: High-toned, multi-layered, intriguingly complex. Wisteria, pineapple, myrrh, cocoa nib, pink grapefruit zest in aroma and cup. Richly sweet-tart structure with vibrant, juicy acidity; crisp yet syrupy mouthfeel. The resounding, flavor-laden finish is both deeply floral and richly sweet-tart.
Notes: Sold as part of a “Dynamic Duo Gesha Village” set that includes a 4-ounce tin of this “natural” Geisha and a 4-ounce tin of a “washed” version of the same coffee that earned 94-points in August 2019. The celebrated Geisha (also spelled Gesha) variety of Arabica first came to the coffee world’s attention growing in Panama. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Geisha in the region from which it originally came. It was grown in western Ethiopia by farmers Adam and Rachel Overton and their indigenous Meanit culture collaborators from seed selected from wild trees of the Geisha variety in the nearby Gori Gesha forest. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than typical wet-processed profiles. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums. Visit www.jbccoffeeroasters.com or call 608-256-5282 for more information.
The Bottom Line: An exquisitely clean natural-processed Gesha cup from Ethiopia, elegantly structured and confidently aromatic.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet, cleanly fruit-driven, floral-toned. Raspberry jam, dark chocolate, gardenia, cedar, maple syrup in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with bright, juicy acidity; crisp though syrupy mouthfeel. A resonant finish centers around raspberry and chocolate with hints of cedar.
Notes: Coffees from the Yirgacheffe region are produced from distinctive, largely indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Like most southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than the more familiar wet-processed profile. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

The Bottom Line: An enticing natural-processed Ethiopia with big fruit notes supported by deep chocolate, rich aromatic wood and impressive spice-toned florals.

Sweet-toned structure with brisk acidity; smooth, satiny mouthfeel. The finish consolidates to notes of dried strawberry and fresh-cut fir with crisp chocolate undertones.
Notes: Produced at Potosí Farm by Luis and Rigoberto Herrera entirely from the San Juan variety of Arabica.

Its motto is “Tough Town, Great Coffee.” Visit www.durangocoffee.com or call 800-748-2275 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Very rich and deeply sweet. Dark chocolate, dried cherry, singed cedar, lilac, candy cap mushroom with layered complexity in aroma and small cup. Very thick, syrupy mouthfeel; the finish consolidates to smoky cocoa and sweetly savory mushroom. In three parts milk, the cup is very chocolaty, sweet and floral with an umami throughline. 
Notes: While most coffees from this region are processed by wet-hulling, this coffee was double-washed in the style of many Kenya coffees.

Blind Assessment:  Nuanced, ethereal, yet exceptionally lush. Aprium, star jasmine, pistachio butter, cocoa, pink peppercorn, almond brittle in aroma and cup. High-toned, sweetly tart in structure with a juicy, vibrant acidity; levitating, nectar-like mouthfeel. The finish is rich-toned and resonant with all of the aromatics and flavors of the cup, star jasmine and cocoa, in particular. 

Notes: This coffee earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees of the Geisha/Gesha variety of Arabica for Coffee Review’s September 2019 tasting report. Produced from the trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also spelled Gesha) by the Lamastus family at Elida Estate. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Geisha/Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. The Green Tip strain is particularly admired. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than the more familiar wet-processed profile.

Blind Assessment: Intoxicatingly (though cleanly) fruit-toned. Raspberry coulis, halvah, plumeria, pink peppercorn, lemon verbena in aroma and cup.

This coffee also tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees of the Geisha/Gesha variety of Arabica for Coffee Review’s September 2019 tasting report.  Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also spelled Gesha) by Orlando and Maria Ospina of Finca La Maria farm.

Blind Assessment: Richly spicy, musky, chocolaty. Mexican chocolate (cocoa nib, vanilla, cinnamon, sugar), dried parsley, nutmeg, musk in aroma and cup. Crisp and piquant in structure; light, silky mouthfeel. The impressive finish is drying yet quite sweet, saturated with chocolate, cinnamon and musk suggestions.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 19 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. This coffee tied for second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees produced using reduced oxygen (“anaerobic”) processing methods for Coffee Review’s November 2019 tasting report. Anaerobic processing in this case means that producer Luis Eduardo Campos fermented this coffee, after pulping or skinning, in a sealed, limited-oxygen stainless steel tank to encourage production of lactic acids that contribute to this sample’s very original cup profile. This coffee was imported by Genuine Origin, a specialty-focused coffee importer based in Irvington, New York. Collage Coffee is a micro-roastery featuring specialty coffee and house brewed kombucha. Colläge works with local artists to promote fine arts in its region, and loves serving its community. This coffee is available for purchase at the Collage store and cafe, 221 South Broad Street, Grove City, Pennsylvania.
The Bottom Line: An anaerobic-processed coffee whose startling originality leans toward musk, chocolate and cinnamon.

Blind Assessment: Intense, original, sweet-spicy. Walnut, gardenia, clove, sandalwood, ripe lemon, a hint of yogurt-like tartness in aroma and cup. Balanced and sweetly pungent in structure. A clove-toned spice lifts and invigorates an otherwise heavyish finish. 
Notes: This coffee tied for second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees produced using reduced oxygen (“anaerobic”) processing methods for Coffee Review’s November 2019 tasting report. Anaerobic processing in this case means this Ethiopia coffee was fermented twice in a sealed oxygen-evacuated tank, first in the whole fruit for two days, then after removal of skin and fruit pulp for two more days. Dory Coffee Roasters is a Taipei-based nano-roaster of specialty coffee. For more information, visit https://www.facebook.com/dorycoffee99/.
The Bottom Line: Drink it for its original yet subtly expressed embodiment of the peculiarly intriguingly sweet-tart genius of anaerobic or lactic acid fermentation.

Blind Assessment: Intense, spicy-sweet, chocolaty. Mexican chocolate (cocoa nib, vanilla, cinnamon, sugar), oak, orange zest, juniper berry or a light whiff of gin in aroma and cup. Sweet but crisp and balanced in structure, with a savory bottom. Light, though quite syrupy, mouthfeel. Cinnamon dominates in the short finish, but cocoa comes forward in a sweet and long-lasting finish.
Notes: This coffee tied for second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees produced using reduced oxygen (“anaerobic”) processing methods for Coffee Review’s November 2019 tasting report. Anaerobic processing, in this case, means that producer Luis Eduardo Campos fermented this coffee, after pulping or skinning, in a sealed, limited-oxygen stainless steel tank to encourage production of lactic acids that contribute to this sample’s very original cup profile. Husband and wife team Samantha and Weston Nawrocki founded Manzanita Roasting on their family’s 127-year-old winery in San Diego. Committed to quality direct-trade sourcing and skillful roasting, they are happy to be a part of what they call San Diego’s new “coffee frontier.” Manzanita offers free shipping on online orders $45 and over. Visit www.manzanitaroasting.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: The complex, sweet-spicy character of Mexican chocolate dominates in this shifting, surprising, but ultimately balanced cup.

Blind Assessment: Bright, intensely pungent, oddly engaging. Spearmint, blueberry, fresh yogurt, sweet cocoa, musk in aroma and cup. Tart and bittersweet in structure; in mouthfeel, syrupy and plush. The finish consolidates richly around suggestions of sweet cocoa and fresh yogurt, with a very slight suggestion of earthy decay. 
Notes: This coffee tied for third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees produced using reduced oxygen (“Anaerobic”) processing methods for Coffee Review’s November 2019 tasting report. Anaerobic processing in this case means this coffee went through “double” or two-stage fermentation in a sealed oxygen-evacuated tank, first in the whole fruit for two days, then after removal of skin and fruit pulp, for two more days. Produced from the celebrated Geisha (also spelled Gesha) variety of Arabica. Lucky Café is a roaster located in the northern Taiwan city of Zhongli committed to developing the best possibilities of the finest coffees available. Visit https://www.facebook.com/lucky.cafe.studio/ or email [email protected] for more information.
The Bottom Line: The startling aromatic surprises of the Geisha variety are overlaid and intensified by the less familiar surprises of an experimental lactic-acid-inducing fermentation step. For those who pursue the rare and remarkable in beverages.

Blind Assessment: Sweet, heavy, musky and perfumy. Elderflowers, fresh cilantro, strawberry-flavored yogurt, lime, musk in aroma and cup. Intensely sweet in structure but balanced by a distinctly crisp, bitter edge. Light, satiny mouthfeel. Flavor consolidates in a sweet though drying finish. 
Notes: This coffee tied for third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees produced using reduced oxygen (“Anaerobic”) processing methods for Coffee Review’s November 2019 tasting report. Anaerobic processing in this case means the coffee, in its whole fruit, was sealed inside limited-oxygen tanks to encourage production of lactic acids that contribute to this sample’s very original cup profile. This coffee won the 2019 Taste of Harvest green coffee competition sponsored by the African Fine Coffee Association. Small Eyes Café is a small, family-owned coffee shop in Yilan, Taiwan, specializing in artisanally roasted specialty coffee and homemade desserts.

The Bottom Line: Drink it for its originality and paradox: Sweet, musky and perfumy yet crisp and bracingly brisk.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet-savory, spice- and floral-toned. Black cherry, tangerine zest, gardenia, marjoram, a hint of bay leaf in aroma and cup. In structure, sweet-tart and juicy with a savory depth. Syrupy and plush in mouthfeel; spicy flowers lead in a quietly flavor-saturated finish.    
Notes: Processed by a variation on the traditional washed process (fruit removed from the beans before drying) that adds no water to the tank during fermentation, hence a “dry” ferment. Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Coffeebar is a radically inclusive Italian café experience based in Truckee, California with locations in Menlo Park, Squaw Valley and Redwood City, as well as a roastery in Reno, Nevada. While it was founded in 2010, Coffeebar only began roasting in-house in 2018. Visit https://www.coffeebar.com/ for more information.
The Bottom Line: A processing variation (fermentation without added water) perhaps contributes to the deep, savory-sweet floral-toned intrigue of this fine washed-process Ethiopia.

Blind Assessment: Vast yet intimate in its layered intricacy: complete and perfectly balanced. Complex flowers (citrus blossom, ginger blossom, aromatic orchid), bright, fresh fruit (pear, peach, tangerine), sweet cocoa, sandalwood, a hint of candycap mushroom in aroma and cup. In structure, juicy and lyrically bright with a subtly pungent umami base; light-footed, satiny mouthfeel. Pear leads into long, vibrantly flavor-saturated finish.  
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 1 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019.

Produced from the celebrated Green Tip Geisha variety of Arabica and processed by slow-dried natural method, in which the coffee in the whole fruit is first sealed in bags, forcing it to ferment with limited exposure to oxygen, then spread to dry in the open on raised tables. The roaster will sell 20 21-gram sets of this coffee starting at 9 am EST on October 22, 2019. Boulder, Colorado-based Dragonfly Coffee was named 2019 Micro-Roaster of the Year by Roast magazine.

Blind Assessment: Brightly fruit-toned, tropical, and aromatically vibrant. Lychee, passionfruit, dark chocolate, frankincense, star jasmine in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet-tart structure with high-toned, juicy acidity; lush, syrupy mouthfeel. Resounding flavor-saturated finish with layer after layer of fruit far into the long. 
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 13 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) grown on Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world. With its bold, boat-shaped beans and distinctive floral and crisply cocoa-toned cup, the Geisha/Gesha continues to be one of the world’s most celebrated and sought-after coffee varieties, and the Esmeralda versions remain among the most authentic. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than typical wet-processed profiles. Campos Coffee is committed to sourcing the finest coffees, with a focus on ethical and sustainable practices. Campos has locations in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, as well as Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah. For more information, visit camposcoffee.com.
The Bottom Line: A levitatingly sweet and juicy coffee, an extravaganza of fruit and flowers with deep chocolate throughout — pure, yet lavish.

Notes: Produced by Café Pacas at Finca La Esperanza entirely of the Red Bourbon variety of Arabica and processed by the honey method (sometimes referred to as “semi-washed”), which means that the outer skin of the coffee fruit is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin.An integral part of New York’s coffee renaissance, Brooklyn-based Café Grumpy opened its first café in 2005 and has since expanded to 10 locations in New York, including a roasting facility, and one in Miami.

This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Souvenir Coffee, based in Berkeley, California goes by the motto, “People first, then coffee.” Visit www.souvenir-coffee.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A fruit-forward natural processed Ethiopia cup with ballast from rich cocoa and floral suggestions throughout the profile.

Blind Assessment: Richly and cleanly fruit-toned, chocolaty. Dried fig, chocolate fudge, molasses, oak, narcissus-like flowers in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet-tart in structure with high-toned, crisp acidity; full, creamy mouthfeel. The resonant flavor-saturated finish centers around fig and chocolate suggestions.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 24 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Produced by the Lamastus family of Elida Estate entirely of the Catuai variety of Arabica and processed by the natural method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Klatch Coffee is an award-winning small-batch roasting company in the Los Angeles area whose resident barista and trainer, Heather Perry, won both the 2003 and 2007 United States Barista Championships brewing a Klatch Coffee espresso blend.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet berry-toned. Ripe strawberry, lilac, sandalwood, cocao nib, hint of thyme in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with gentle, round acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. Cocoa-toned sandalwood characterizes the resonant finish.
Notes: Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Blues Brew Coffee is Taipei-based coffee roaster seeking the highest quality coffees for the enjoyment of global coffee-lovers.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Attractively roast-prominent, deeply sweet and complex. Scorched cedar, baking chocolate, blackberry jam, blood orange zest, marjoram, violet-like flowers in aroma and small cup. Lightly creamy, almost fluffy mouthfeel. Finish consolidates around an herb-toned chocolate enveloped in a smoky resonance. In three parts milk, intensely sweet and aromatically vibrant, supported by a rich, smoky depth.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 4 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Produced entirely from trees of the SL-28 variety of Arabica, the variety associated with the finest Kenya coffees. Processed by the yellow honey method. With all honey processing methods, some sweet pulp or fruit flesh (“honey”) is allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. In the yellow honey variation, a thin layer of pulp is allowed to dry on the beans, more than with white honey, but much less than is the case with red or black honey. In addition to his retail roasting operation, Aroma Roast Coffees, Simon Hsieh also operates Soaring Phoenix Trading, a business focused on purpose-built commercial espresso blends and high quality single-origin coffees. Customers can also visit the new showroom, Chateau Andy, in Taipei City. Visit www.facebook.com/4ArtsZeroDefectCoffees or call 886-0983-749876 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Delicate, intricately sweet, vibrant  and impeccably balanced. Rose, crisp fruit (green apple, Bing cherry, wild strawberry), honey, tangerine zest, dragonwell green tea, fresh juniper in aroma and cup. The structure is incredibly sweet and juicy, yet zesty and richly tart. Light, but very silky mouthfeel. Flavor consolidates in the finish with a delicately crisp, sweet resonance.
Notes: This coffee won second place in the 2019 Best of Panama green coffee competition. Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) grown on Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world. With its bold, boat-shaped beans and distinctive floral and crisply cocoa-toned cup, the Geisha/Gesha continues to be one of the world’s most celebrated and sought-after coffee varieties, and the Esmeralda versions remain among the most authentic. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting but before drying. Boulder, Colorado-based Dragonfly Coffee was named 2019 Micro-Roaster of the Year by Roast magazine. Visit www.dragonflycoffeeroasters.com or call 303-579-2154 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A stunning, high-toned Geisha, downright majestic in the clarity of its aromatics and lyrical structure.

Visit www.m.facebook.com/4pluscoffee for more information.
The Bottom Line: A friendly, accessible Ethiopia cup animated by pleasing berry and spicy floral notes.

Blind Assessment: Bizarre, beautiful, shocking, intricate. Tropical fruit (lychee, passionfruit), sweet herb (clove, cilantro, dill, spearmint), dark chocolate, musk, yogurt. In structure quite sweet, roundly tart (think unsweetened yogurt), deeply savory. Lightly syrupy in mouthfeel. Passionfruit, chocolate, dill all make distinct appearances in the drying but sweetly and richly complex finish.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 10 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. This coffee also earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees produced using reduced oxygen (“anaerobic”) processing methods for Coffee Review’s November 2019 tasting report. The intensity and complexity of this extraordinary coffee are owing both to tree variety and processing method. The variety is the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also spelled Gesha). Joseph Brodsky and his colleagues processed this Geisha at Ninety Plus Gesha Estates in Panama using a refined and innovative processing procedure involving fermenting the whole, freshly-picked coffee fruit at high temperatures using a special yeast strain before drying it, still in the whole fruit. Willoughby’s Coffee & Tea is a pioneer specialty coffee roaster established in the early 1980s that has gracefully and successfully moved with the  times and now offers a menu of extremely refined small-lot, single-origin coffees. Visit www.willoughbyscoffee.com or call 800-388-8400 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A lush, juicy, tropical natural-processed profile overlaid on a deep, spicy/savory profile with something else as well, an edge we might associate with fermented foods like yogurt or pickles. Clearly for coffee adventurers.

Blind Assessment: Crisply sweet, richly tart-savory. Dried apricot, marjoram, wild honey, oak, narcissus in aroma and cup. Balanced sweet-tart structure with vibrant, juicy acidity; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The finish consolidates to dried apricot and marjoram with undertones of honey.
Notes: This coffee tied for second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees produced using reduced oxygen (“anaerobic”) processing methods for Coffee Review’s November 2019 tasting report. Anaerobic processing, in this case, means that producer Luis Eduardo Campos fermented this coffee, after pulping or skinning, in a sealed, limited-oxygen stainless steel tank to encourage production of lactic acids that contribute to this sample’s very original cup profile. This coffee was imported by Genuine Origin, a specialty-focused coffee importer based in Irvington, New York. B&W Coffee Roasters is a North Carolina-based roastery and cafe specializing in small-lot direct-trade coffees. For more information, visit www.blackwhiteroasters.com.
The Bottom Line: A high-toned, cleanly fruit-forward Costa Rica cup with deeply rich savory underpinnings.

Blind Assessment: Deeply and richly sweet, resonantly juicy. Red currant, lavender, dark chocolate, sandalwood, fine musk in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory structure with vibrant, lively acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. Both the aromatics and poised structure carry far into the finish with finesse and persistence. 
Notes: Processed by a particularly meticulous Kenya variation on the traditional wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Quartet Kaffe is an artisan roastery in Taiwan founded in 2018, dedicated to pursuing coffee performance art and offering unique speciality coffee. Visit www.facebook.com/QuartetKaffe for more information.
The Bottom Line: A beautifully balanced, classically sweet-savory Kenya cup with great depth and sweet, musky resonance.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Ultra-rich, chocolaty, deep musky resonance. Perique pipe tobacco, salted chocolate fudge, candied fig, pink grapefruit zest, lavender, fresh earth after a rain in aroma and small cup. Thick, velvety mouthfeel. The short finish consolidates around rich tobacco and cocoa with delicate floral hints and earthy depth in the long. Deeply sweet and satisfying in three parts milk; flavor saturates the milk with impressive continuity and vivacity. 
Notes: Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet hulling.” Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

The Bottom Line: An intense and gratifying Sumatran coffee, offering the qualities that make Sumatra an exciting origin for many coffee lovers (earth/tobacco, cocoa, sweetness, citrus) without the overly pungent earthy characteristics that often shadow this origin. For those who appreciate the type, this coffee is superb and rewarding.

Blind Assessment: Delicate, berry-toned, deeply sweet. Wild strawberry, honey, freesia-like flowers, oak, almond paste in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with juicy, high-toned acidity; lively, silky mouthfeel. Resonant, flavor-saturated finish sustains all of the notes from the cup, wild strawberry and almond in particular.
Notes: Coffees from the Yirgacheffe region are produced from distinctive, largely indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Like most southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than the more familiar wet-processed profile. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.
The Bottom Line: An exceptionally purely expressed natural-processed Yirgacheffe cup, berry- and nut-driven, supported by spicy floral notes throughout.

Blind Assessment: Delicate, floral-toned. Narcissus-like flowers, honey, cocoa nib, apricot, fresh-cut cedar in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with juicy, vibrant acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The rich, floral-laden finish is rife with supporting notes of apricot and cocoa nib.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Processed by the washed or wet method, meaning the soft fruit residue was removed from the beans before drying. This coffee is certified Fair Trade, meaning it was purchased at a formula-determined “fair” or economically sustainable price. Established in 2010, Red Rooster is an organic-certified micro-roaster focusing on socially conscious coffee and high-quality coffee.

Blind Assessment: Delicately and complexly aromatic, levitatingly high-toned. Dried passionfruit, aromatic orchid, frankincense, cocoa nib, tangerine zest in aroma and cup. Elegantly sweet structure with rich, vibrant acidity; lively, silky mouthfeel. The very long finish centers around frankincense-toned passionfruit and aromatic orchid with a cocoa throughline.
Notes: This coffee took first place in the 2019 Best of Panama green coffee competition and subsequently was auctioned for the then highest price ever paid for a green, unroasted coffee: US$1,029 per pound. Produced from the celebrated Green Tip Geisha variety of Arabica and processed by slow-dried natural method, in which the coffee in the whole fruit is first sealed in bags, forcing it to ferment with limited exposure to oxygen, then spread to dry in the open on raised tables. Klatch Coffee is an award-winning small-batch roasting company in the Los Angeles area whose resident barista and trainer, Heather Perry, won both the 2003 and 2007 United States Barista Championships brewing a Klatch Coffee espresso blend.

Blind Assessment: Deeply sweet, complex, vibrantly rich. Dark chocolate, deep fruit notes (guava, raspberry jam, pineapple), aromatic orchid, frankincense, cedar-toned tobacco in aroma and cup. The acidity, while not bright, is enveloped in an elaborate and balanced structure with deep composure; mouthfeel is full and very syrupy. The short finish is chocolaty and sweet, with floral hints and a fine tobacco note resonating through to the long.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 8 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea Arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Yemen coffee is still grown from ancient heirloom cultivars of Arabica on stone-walled terraces ringing fortress-like mountaintop villages. All Yemen coffees are natural-processed, or dried in the whole fruit. This particular Yemen was produced by smallholding farmers in the village of Al Hayma and processed by exporter Port of Mokha, which has worked closely with farmers to improve harvesting and drying procedures. Plat Coffee is a specialty roaster and café in Hong Kong. For more information, visit www.platcoffee.com.
The Bottom Line: An immense, engaging coffee: classically Yemen with cocoa, fruit and tobacco and a deep, quiet elegance.

Blind Assessment: High-toned, richly fruit-forward, balanced. Strawberry guava, jasmine, cocoa nib, sandalwood, pink grapefruit zest in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with crisp, bright acidity; vibrantly plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant finish centers around guava and jasmine notes with undertones of cocoa nib.
Notes: This coffee from the Puna District of Hawaii, comprised of the Typica and Caturra varieties of Arabica, was processed using an unusual sequence of procedures. It was first fermented in the whole fruit with wine yeasts added to the tank, then dried in the whole fruit, making it, in effect, a fermented natural. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information. 
The Bottom Line: A fruit- and floral-toned coffee from a lesser-known growing region on the Big Island of Hawai’i is worth seeking out for its balanced completeness and its suggestions of the tropics, both aromatically and in the cup.

Blind Assessment: Very roast-prominent, chocolaty and spiced-toned. Chocolate, charred mesquite, date, baking spices, dark caramel in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with a bitter edge; full though drying mouthfeel. The finish, while sweet, is dominated by burned wood notes that obscure the underlying chocolate and fruit.
Notes: This blend was purchased from a Peet’s Coffee retail location as a nationally branded benchmark comparison for the holiday blends from other smaller roasters reviewed this month. It is comprised of three coffees: a wet-hulled Sumatra Batak, a washed-process Panama Finca Don Bosco, and a washed-process Kenya. Peet’s Coffee, now a national chain, was founded by Alfred Peet in 1966, making it one of the first and most influential artisan coffee roasters in the U.S. Visit www.peets.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: An interesting blend skillfully dark-roasted, save for the bitter, burned finish. Otherwise, quietly intriguing, sweet and smoky.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Bright, sweetly tart, high-toned. Black cherry, chocolate fudge, almond butter, freesia-like flowers, sandalwood in aroma and small cup. Crisp, satiny mouthfeel; resonant fruit-toned finish. Particularly floral-saturated in three parts milk, with dark chocolate and cherry undertones.
Notes: Produced by Mekuriya Gobena in the Yirgacheffe growing region of Ethiopia on his 12-acre farm. This is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A richly sweet, delicately tart natural-process Yirgacheffe cup, deftly roasted toward the darker end of medium to develop chocolate notes without dampening the bright fruit and sweet flowers.

Blind Assessment: Round, sweet, complex, original. Magnolia, musk, lemon verbena, maple syrup, complex fruit (peach, jackfruit) in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweetly low-toned in structure; buoyant and satiny in mouthfeel. Rich, round, pungently layered finish: peach, magnolia. 
Notes: This coffee is sold only as a part of the Paradise Roasters Rare Coffees Tour subscription series. Eugenioides is a species of coffee that botanists believe spontaneously crossed with Robusta to create the Arabica species 10,000 to 25,000 years ago. Over the last few years some farms have experimented with producing small volumes of pure Eugenioides. Marked by great sweetness coupled with often savory-leaning complexity, Eugenioides can produce an original and striking cup. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.
The Bottom Line: Both surprising in aromatics and richly reassuring in sweetness and balance. Look for this very rare coffee when it comes around again in 2020 at Paradise Roasters.

Notes: Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) grown on Price Peterson’s Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world.

Blind Assessment: Delicate, complex, multi-layered. Bergamot, dark chocolate, nougat, narcissus, cedar in aroma and cup. Richly sweet-savory structure with citrusy acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. The floral- and fruit-driven finish is supported by chocolate and aromatic wood notes.
Notes: Produced entirely from trees of the native Ethiopian varieties Kurume and Welicho at Suke Quto farm. Processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin of the coffee fruit is removed, as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin.

Notes: Produced from trees of the SL28, SL34, Ruiru 11 and Batian varieties of Arabica.

Black Coffee in Black Jar, a Taiwan-based nano-roaster and café, is named for both the Taiwanese slang phrase “black soy sauce in black jar,” indicating something is difficult to see through, and the literal black jar in which this company stores coffee to protect it from UV light.

Blind Assessment: Deeply and sweetly pungent; layered and intricate. Dark chocolate, raspberry, freesia, port wine, a hint of fresh, fragrant tobacco in aroma and cup. Balanced, quietly forceful in its sweet-savory structure; light but exceptionally silky in mouthfeel. All notes ring on in a layered, flavor-saturated finish.
Notes: Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was produced in Kona and is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500 foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This rare coffee is only available on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.
The Bottom Line: An aromatically complex, original cup that balances an enveloping sweetness with a quietly forceful pungency.

This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Euphora Coffee is a Taipei-based specialty coffee roaster with an active online community through which all sales are made. Visit www.euphoracoffeestudio.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: An elegant, subtle coffee with leading notes of stonefruit and cocoa nib and especially lively acidity.

Blind Assessment: Richly, sweetly tart, deeply chocolaty. Dark chocolate fudge, grape candy, sandalwood, violet, magnolia in aroma and cup. Tartly sweet structure with vibrant, juicy acidity; creamy, plush mouthfeel. The long, resonant finish centers on grape candy and chocolate fudge, with a backgrounded sandalwood.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Quartet Kaffe is an artisan roastery in Taiwan founded in 2018, dedicated to pursuing coffee performance art and offering unique speciality coffee. Visit www.facebook.com/QuartetKaffe for more information.
The Bottom Line: A fruit- and chocolate- bomb of a coffee, dessert-like with its rich-toned, candy-like sweetness.

Blind Assessment: Intricate, pungent, deeply floral. Peach, pear, honeysuckle, black walnut, musk in aroma and cup. Brisk but very sweet in structure with a savory edge; satiny, lively mouthfeel. Crisp, flavor-saturated finish. 
Notes: Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was grown in Kona. This lot consists of a blend of two different processing methods, natural and washed.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Sweet, odd, earth-toned. Caramel, orange, pecan, a hint of dark chocolate and a lot of fruit-scented earth--think fallen oranges in a citrus grove--in aroma and small cup. Fluffy mouthfeel. Chocolate comes forward in a sweet though drying finish. Three parts milk further develops the chocolate, while the earth notes persist, particularly in the finish. 
Notes: This coffee was processed by the washed method (fruit skin and pulp removed before drying), then aged for three years in its parchment skins before hulling and shipping. Telluride is an artisan roaster situated at high elevations in Colorado offering an attractive range of single-origins and blends. Visit www.telluridecoffeeroasters.net for more information.
The Bottom Line: The sweet, fruit-on-the-edge of decay character central to this curious aged espresso may please those espresso drinkers who value surprise, while probably offending coffee purists. If you’re not sure which camp you’re in, you might try it--the price is right.

Blind Assessment: Deep, intense, sweet-savory, utterly coherent. Intense lavender, black currant, mandarin orange, sandalwood, dark chocolate in aroma and cup. Sweet, tart, savory-bottomed structure with intense, balanced acidity; big, mouth-filling body. The flavor-saturated finish carries over every nuance from the cup.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 17 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020.  The coffee tied for the highest rating in a cupping of “desert-island coffees” submitted by roasters for Coffee Review’s May 2020 tasting report. This version of the ancient Mocha-Java blend combines a traditionally processed, wet-hulled Sumatra in place of the original Java and replaces the Yemen Mocha with a similar “natural” or dried-in-the-fruit coffee from Ethiopia. One of the country’s pioneering socially and environmentally progressive roasters, Thanksgiving aimed to combine coffee quality with social and environmental responsibility many years before the latter preoccupations became fashionable. Visit www.thanksgivingcoffee.com or call 800-648-6491 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A paradoxically richly savory yet singingly sweet interpretation of the classic Mocha Java blend — complex, nuanced, multi-layered.

Blind Assessment: Sweetly and richly earth-toned. Black currant, cocoa powder, fresh humus, malt, magnolia in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory structure with gentle, round acidity; very smooth, satiny mouthfeel. The resonant finish centers on cocoa and sweet earth notes.
Notes: This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a cupping of “desert-island coffees” submitted by roasters for Coffee Review’s May 2020 tasting report. Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type. Cloud City Coffee is a specialty roaster and coffee shop founded in 2002 by roaster Jill Killen. Visit www.cloudcitycoffeeroasting.com.
The Bottom Line: A classic Sumatra: sweetly pungent fruit, fresh earth and dry, chocolaty
grace notes.

Blind Assessment: Deeply rich, balanced, fruit- and floral-toned. Tea rose, pomelo, dark chocolate, pie cherry, fresh-cut oak in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with round, fruit-toned acidity; rich, satiny mouthfeel. Tea rose, pie cherry and dark chocolate saturate the resonant finish.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of “desert-island coffees” submitted by roasters for Coffee Review’s May 2020 tasting report. The celebrated Geisha (also spelled Gesha) variety of Arabica first came to the coffee world’s attention growing in Panama. This particular version, however, is the outcome of successful efforts to commercialize Geisha in the region from which it originally came, western Ethiopia, from seed selected from wild trees of the Geisha variety in the nearby Gori Gesha forest. Processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). Plat Coffee is a specialty roaster and café in Hong Kong. For more information, visit www.platcoffee.com.
The Bottom Line: A pretty natural-processed Ethiopia Gesha produced at the highly regarded Gesha Village estate, with deep floral and fruit tones in harmonious balance.

Sweet structure with gentle, round acidity; full, velvety mouthfeel. Finish consolidates to notes of baking chocolate and magnolia in the short, cedar and hazelnut in the crisp long.
Notes: Certified organic. Produced from trees of the Typica variety of Arabica and processed by the wet, or washed, method (fruit is removed before drying). This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Hala Tree Coffee is a family-owned organic Kona coffee farm located in the heart of the Kona coffee belt, overlooking historic Kealakekua Bay. The 100% Kona Coffee produced on this USDA organic-certified property is processed and roasted on site to ensure quality. For more information, visit www.halatreecoffee.com.
The Bottom Line: A chocolaty and floral-toned Kona Typica peaberry cup, richly layered, softly intriguing.

Blind Assessment: Very sweet; floral and yogurt-like. Pineapple kefir, dark chocolate, cashew, tiger lily, kumquat in aroma and cup. Completely original structure: quite sweet, with a delicately tart character associated with lactic acid fermentation. Lively, crisply round mouthfeel. Richly intricate, layered, flavored-saturated finish.
Notes: Produced by Gonzalo Hernandez at his Coffea Diversa “coffee garden” in Costa Rica entirely of the Deweverei variety of coffea Liberica. Liberica is a species of coffee native to central Africa and long cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia. Processed by the carbonic maceration natural method, which involves fermenting whole fruit inside a sealed container that has been flushed with CO2. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.
The Bottom Line: An exceedingly rare coffee in all respects: A genuinely fine coffee produced from trees of the overlooked and poorly regarded Liberica species, processed by the still unusual carbonic maceration method. The result is a cup that is wildly original and engagingly complex.

This is a “natural” or dry-processed version (beans are dried in the whole fruit). Dragonfly Coffee, named 2019 Micro-Roaster of the Year by Roast magazine, is now based in Henderson, Nevada. Visit dragonflycoffeeroasters.com or call 303-579-2154 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A cleanly fruit-toned natural-process Ethiopia cup animated by bright berry and deeply sweet floral tones.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso produced as a ristretto 25ml (.85-ounce) shot using a Nespresso capsule espresso brewer with whole milk heated using a conventional steam wand. Delicate, floral-toned. Honeysuckle, white peach, lime zest, cocoa nib, cedar in aroma and small cup. Silky, buoyant mouthfeel. The elegant finish centers around notes of honeysuckle and lime zest, with cocoa nib lingering into the long. Cappuccino-scaled milk further amplifies floral and chocolate tones.
Notes: One of the world’s most celebrated coffees presented in a Nespresso-compatible capsule. With its bold, boat-shaped beans and distinctive floral and crisply cacao-toned cup, Geisha (also Gesha) continues to be one of the world’s most celebrated and sought-after coffee varieties, and the Hacienda La Esmeralda Geishas remain among the most authentic. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version.

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Notes of peach, pomegranate, a whiff of rum barrel, cocoa powder, jasmine. Sweet-tart structure with high-toned acidity; crisp, satiny mouthfeel. The acidy brightness fades in the finish, leaving pretty fruit notes (peach, pomegranate) with hints of vaguely fermenty sweetness we associated with rum barrel. In milk, fruit recedes and cocoa powder comes to the fore. 
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 21 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020.  The coffee tied for the highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2020 tasting report. Prepared by the cold-brew method, which involves prolonged steeping of ground coffee in cold or room-temperature water and subsequent filtering. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. Infused with nitrogen when canned. The green coffee used is a natural-processed Ethiopia Guji Uraga. Corvus Coffee Roasters is based in Denver, Colorado and specializes in rare and exclusive coffees from some of the finest growers in the world. Corvus particularly focuses on processing methods and selective harvesting, which result in small, seasonal micro-lots of uniquely sweet, vibrant, and clean flavor profiles.

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Crisp, sweetly tart, multi-layered. Black cherry, rhododendron, marzipan, oak, baking chocolate. Sweet-tart structure with brisk acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. Marzipan and oak carry into the quietly engaging finish. Milk changes the equation entirely; rhododendron and baking chocolate take center stage with levity added by the infused nitrogen.
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2020 tasting report. Prepared by the cold-brew method, which involves prolonged steeping of ground coffee in cold or room-temperature water and subsequent filtering. Infused with nitrogen gas after brewing.

Topéca Coffee is an artisan roaster with three café locations and a roastery in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Visit www.topecacoffee.com or call 918-398-8022 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A balanced, approachably complex nitro cold brew made from Topéca’s longstanding Porch Session Blend. Be forewarned: owing to a very high coffee-to-water brewing ration, one 8.4-ounce can contains as much caffeine as a 20-ounce cup of hot-brewed coffee!

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Bing cherry, sassafras, aromatic orchid, bay tree, brandy. Sweet-tart structure with juicy, bright acidity; lush, mouth-filling viscosity. Long, resonant, flavor-saturated finish that carries over all the notes from the cup. Quiet and elegant in milk, with all flavor notes represented at a lower volume.
Notes: This coffee tied for the highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2020 tasting report. Prepared by the cold-brew method, which involves prolonged steeping of ground coffee in cold or room-temperature water and subsequent filtering. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. The green coffee used is a washed Brazil Ipanema that was processed in an atypical way, including a 34-hour pre-drying period on patio, followed by 44 hours in vertical driers before storage in double-barrier bags, at which point the roaster surmises that fermentation continues, resulting in a winy aroma and flavor more often associated with natural-processed coffees. The roaster sells this coffee as whole bean for NT $500/200 grams. GK Coffee is a nano-roastery in Yilan, Taiwan that offers both retail and wholesale coffee. For more information, visit www.gkcoffee.com.tw or email [email protected]
The Bottom Line: Tasted blind, this reads like a natural-processed coffee, but it is fully washed with an unusual, and very appealing sweet ferment, suggesting cherry liqueur. Delicious with a side of high-quality dark chocolate.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet-savory, complex, nuanced. Butterscotch, hop flowers, sandalwood, dried apricot, candycap mushroom in aroma and cup.

Notes: Produced by Girma Eshetu on his single-farmer estate from trees of varieties of Arabica long grown in the region.

Vibrantly sweet-tart structure with juicy, fruit-forward acidity; creamy-smooth mouthfeel. Finish consolidates to suggestions of dried blueberry, chocolate fudge and rum barrel.
Notes: Produced at Hacienda Tobosi entirely of the Villa Sarchi variety of Arabica and processed by the black honey method, in which the skins are removed from the fruit but virtually all of the pulp is allowed to dry on the beans, often resulting in a deep, pungent profile.

Blind Assessment: Sweetly pungent, juicy. Tangerine, dark chocolate, almond butter, honeysuckle, a hint of kefir in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with bold, lactic acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. The layered finish consolidates to notes of tangerine and sweet yogurt. 
Notes: Certified organic. Produced entirely from trees of the Red Bourbon variety of Arabica and processed by the dry or “natural” method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or ""washed"" coffees. Limited release available only as part of Hala Tree's Tasting Club.  Hala Tree Coffee is a family-owned organic Kona coffee farm in the heart of the Kona coffee belt, overlooking historic Kealakekua Bay.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet, deeply aromatic, vibrant. Dried apricot, dark chocolate, narcissus, pink grapefruit zest, sandalwood in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with lively, balanced acidity; full, creamy mouthfeel. A quiet finish centers around chocolate and apricot notes supported by sandalwood.
Notes: This coffee comes from four growing regions in Yemen: Hajja, Haraz, Beni Ismael and Beni Matar. Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea Arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Yemen coffee is still grown from ancient cultivars of arabica on stone-walled terraces. All Yemen coffees are natural-processed, or dried in the whole fruit. This particular Yemen may owe its striking aromatics to ancient tree varieties, but its clean elegance is most likely owing to the efforts of exporter Rayyan Mill in the capital of Sana’a, which has worked with farmers to improve picturesque but often haphazard harvesting and drying procedures. Baba Java is a specialty roaster and cafe retailer located in Hoover Alabama that strives to provide the best coffee experience at every step. Visit www.babajavacoffee.com or call 205-777-5984 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A lovely introduction to the pleasures of Yemen: fruit-toned yet balanced, floral yet restrained, and mysterious with its throughline of deep aromatic wood that is more perfumy than earthy.

Blind Assessment: Very sweet, high-toned, with savory underpinnings. Tangerine zest, cocoa nib, Bing cherry, amber, almond butter in aroma and cup. Tart-leaning but integrated  structure with vibrant, juicy acidity; full, viscous mouthfeel. The finish is animated by notes of Bing cherry and amber.

Located overlooking Lake Kivu, on the opposite side of the lake from Rwanda, this rapidly growing cooperative now has nearly 6,000 members and apparently is succeeding in its goal to help heal wounds left by the latest in eastern Congo’s seemingly endless string of horrific rebellions and civil wars.

Blind Assessment: Profoundly sweet, fruit-forward, candy-like. Clementine orange, Jolly Rancher, milk chocolate, cane sugar, narcissus in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with juicy, vibrant acidity; viscous, honey-like mouthfeel. The prolonged finish evokes cotton candy laced with milk chocolate.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 14 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020.  The coffee tied for the highest rating in a cupping of coffees roasted by Black-owned coffee companies for Coffee Review’s August 2020 report. Produced by smallholding farmers from trees of the rare indigenous Ethiopia Wush Wush variety of Arabica. Processed by fermenting the fresh coffee fruit in an oxygen-free environment before drying it in the whole fruit. Equiano Coffee was founded in 2013 by the Udosenatas family. For more information, visit www.equianocoffee.com.
The Bottom Line: So headily perfumed that this Ethiopia Wush Wush reads like dessert, redolent with more fruit tones than we can name, enveloped by a rich milk chocolate.

Sweet in structure with brisk acidity; satiny, delicate mouthfeel. The gently drying finish leads with caramel and pear in the short, resolving to walnut and fir in the long. 
Notes: This coffee earned the fifth-highest rating in a cupping of coffees roasted by Black-owned coffee companies for Coffee Review’s August 2020 report. Coffee trees were brought to Haiti in 1715 when the country was colonized by the French. Farmed by enslaved people, most crops were destroyed in the Haitian revolution of 1791.

Blind Assessment: Fruit-toned, tropical. Lychee, guava, cocoa nib, violet, sandalwood in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with crisp, high-toned acidity; lightly syrupy mouthfeel. The finish centers around lychee and sandalwood notes.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are produced largely from local, indigenous varieties of Arabica. Produced by smallholding members of the Nano Challa Cooperative and processed by the wet, or washed, method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying). SkyTop Coffee is a USDA certified-organic specialty coffee roaster based in Manlius, New York. For more information, visit skytopcoffee.com. 
The Bottom Line: A particularly fruit-centered washed-process Ethiopia cup, tropical leaning in its aromatics with a mysterious and pretty note of sandalwood running throughout.

Blind Assessment: Complex — floral, citrusy, and multi-layered. Lime blossom, bergamot, lemon verbena, cocoa nib, frankincense in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet structure with high-toned, vibrant acidity. Rich, syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant, flavor-saturated finish goes on and on.

Notes: Produced by Oscar and Francisca Chacon entirely from trees of the Caturra variety of Arabica; certified organically grown.

Its motto is “Tough Town, Great Coffee.” Visit www.durangocoffee.com or call 800-748-2275 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Deep, complex, sweetly pungent. Red currant, dark chocolate, moist fresh-fallen leaves, maple syrup, star jasmine in aroma and cup. Crisply sweet-savory in structure; plush, buoyant mouthfeel. Flavor resonates long into a richly drying finish.
Notes: Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type, produced in the Lintong region south of Lake Toba, one of the oldest and arguably the most admired of Sumatra growing regions. Peacock Coffee Roaster is a specialty coffee roaster in Taipei, Taiwan. Visit https://www.facebook.com/Peacock.Coffee.Roaster for more information.
The Bottom Line: A fine example of a traditional Sumatra cup: viscous, juicy, aromatically driven by deep, earth-toned fruit and dry chocolate.

Blind Assessment: Bright, sweetly spice-toned. Cinnamon, candy apple, grapefruit zest, freesia-like flowers, a hint of fresh yogurt in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with lively, high-toned acidity; crisp, satiny mouthfeel. The finish continues spice-toned and rich.
Notes: Produced by Don Luis Campos of Cordillera del Fuego and processed by the “thermic” method, in which beans, with skins removed, are heated with some of the fruit flesh or mucilage still adhering to them. The exposure to heat starts to break down the natural sugars of the mucilage, partially caramelizing it. This coffee was imported by Genuine Origin, a specialty-focused coffee importer based in Irvington, New York. Collage Coffee is a micro-roastery featuring specialty coffee and house brewed kombucha. Colläge works with local artists to promote fine arts in its region, and loves serving its community. This coffee is available for purchase at the Collage store and cafe, 221 South Broad Street, Grove City, Pennsylvania.

This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Certified USDA organic. Founded in 1990, Lexington Coffee is an award-winning artisan roasting company based in Virginia. Lexington’s focus on fresh, distinctive and sustainable coffee is reflected in its motto, “Fresh, Flavorful & Fair.” Visit www.lexingtoncoffee.com or call 800-322-6505 for more information.
The Bottom Line: Fruit, flowers, and chocolate come together in harmonious balance in this impressively deep-toned natural-processed Ethiopia cup.

Blind Assessment: Delicately fruit-toned, floral. Strawberry, narcissus, lemon verbena, cocoa nib, cedar in aroma and cup. Sweet structure with gentle, round acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. The richly sweet finish consolidates to cocoa-toned narcissus and strawberry.
Notes: Certified USDA Organic. Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from indigenous varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is rounder and lower-toned than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. The company name Amavida combines the Spanish words for love and life, reflecting Amavida’s multifaceted commitment to fairness and fine coffee. For more information, visit www.amavida.com or call 850-213-1965.
The Bottom Line: A balanced, richly floral natural-processed Ethiopia cup redolent with sweet berry tones throughout the profile.

Blind Assessment: Crisply tart, chocolaty. Lime zest, dried apricot, chocolate fudge, agave syrup, cedar in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with gentle, round acidity; lightly syrupy mouthfeel. The deep finish is richly drying, very chocolaty. 
Notes: Doi Pangkhon is an emerging growing district in the Golden Triangle region of northern Thailand.

Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions.

A wet-processed or “washed” coffee version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums. Visit www.jbccoffeeroasters.com or call 608-256-5282 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A nuanced, spice-toned cup centered around floral and citrus notes with undertones of sweet garden herbs.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso produced as a “ristretto” 25ml (.85-ounce) shot using a Nespresso capsule espresso brewer with whole milk heated using a conventional steam wand. Richly aromatic, floral and balanced. Jasmine, orange zest, baking chocolate, pear, cedar in aroma and small cup. Silky-smooth mouthfeel.

Blind Assessment: Graceful, polished, exquisitely floral. Lavender, vanilla bean, bergamot, cocoa nib, lychee in aroma and cup. Delicate, vivid, multi-layered structure with elegantly sweet-tart acidity; very silky, buoyant mouthfeel. Elongated, richly floral, complex finish.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 1 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020. The coffee won first place in the washed Geisha category of the 2020 Best of Panama green coffee competition and was subsequently sold at auction for a price that broke all previous records for a green coffee. Produced at Finca Sophia entirely from trees of the celebrated Geisha variety of Arabica. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. GK Coffee is a nano-roastery in Yilan, Taiwan that offers both retail and wholesale coffee. Only sold via email request. For more information, visit www.gkcoffee.com.tw or email [email protected]
The Bottom Line: This Best of Panama winner also won us over with its layers of floral tones (lavender, violet, jasmine, freesia) delicately ensconced in cocoa and tropical fruit notes, all complicated by a lightly bracing bittersweet citrus.

Blind Assessment: Delicately sweet-savory, floral-toned. Lilac, plum, almond brittle, lemon verbena, gently scorched elm in aroma and cup. RIchly bittersweet structure with gentle acidity; syrupy-smooth mouthfeel. The finish centers around notes of lemon verbena and lightly scorched elm.

After the coffee fruit is pulped, it is processed with a yeast-ferment step (with no additional water being added to the tank) prior to being washed. Kraig and Leslie Lee have been growing and harvesting traditional Kona Coffee for over 25 years. In 2017 they introduced several distinguished new tree varieties to their 4.7 acre farm, including this one, which they are offering for the first time. Visit konafarmdirect.com for more information.

Blind Assessment: Complex, sweetly pungent. Nectarine, magnolia, musk, cashew butter, maple syrup in aroma and cup. Briskly sweet structure with savory undertones; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. Crisply sweet-savory finish. 
Notes: Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was grown in Kona and processed by the anaerobic natural fermentation method. Kraig and Leslie Lee have been growing and harvesting traditional Kona Coffee for over 25 years.

Blind Assessment: Poised, balanced, quietly complete. Cocoa nib, green grape, freesia-like flowers, roasted almond, brown sugar in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweet-toned structure with vivacious acidity; lively, satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The finish focuses around notes of green grape and freesia with almond undertones.
Notes: This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading.

The resonant finish leads with notes of dried mango and hazelnut supported by honey tones throughout.
Notes: Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from indigenous varieties of landrace Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is rounder and lower-toned than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile.

Blind Assessment: Subtly powerful, harmoniously integrated, complete. Pineapple, nectarine, complex florals, cocoa nib, roasted pine nut in aroma and cup. Stunningly bright and expressive structure with very balanced acidity. Silky, buoyant mouthfeel. A deep, very long finish retains the grace and complexity of the cup through to the end.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 4 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020. Produced at Finca Sophia entirely from trees of the celebrated Geisha variety of Arabica. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying). This coffee was produced on the same farm under the same conditions as the lot that won the 2020 Best of Panama competition in the washed Geisha category (which famously sold at auction for a record-breaking $1,300.50 per pound) but it is not from the actual record-breaking lot. Founded in 1995 by Brooke McDonnell and Helen Russell, Equator Coffees operates retail stores in the San Francisco Bay Area and provides coffee to hundreds of wholesale accounts.  Visit www.equatorcoffees.com or call 800-809-7687 for more information.

 
The Bottom Line: A lush, ethereal, complexly seductive experience of Panama Geisha, with intricate floral notes (plumeria, freesia, lilac, musk) interwoven with tropical fruit and cocoa.

Blind Assessment: Chocolaty, richly sweet-tart, deep-toned. Chocolate fudge, passion fruit, sandalwood, lily, a hint of Cognac in aroma and cup. Sweetly and opulently tart with generous, bright acidity; lush, viscous mouthfeel. Sandalwood- and chocolate-toned finish with undertones of passionfruit into the long.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 6 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020. Mocca (also spelled Moka and Mokka) is a rare and famous variety of Arabica that reached Kaanapali, Hawaii from Brazil. Current thinking in the technical coffee community is that it originated in the Reunion Islands as a mutant of the great Bourbon variety, although it closely resembles a variety long grown in Yemen called Ismaili. This Mocca was processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). This rare coffee with its tiny beans and striking cup is available only on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400- and 2,500-foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.

A wet-processed or “washed” version (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying). Founded in 1990, Lexington Coffee is an award-winning artisan roasting company based in Virginia. Lexington’s focus on fresh, distinctive and sustainable coffee is reflected in its motto, “Fresh, Flavorful & Fair.” Visit www.lexingtoncoffee.com or call 800-322-6505 for more information.

Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions.

Drink Coffee Do Stuff operates a roastery in Truckee, California and a coffee shop in nearby Incline Village, Nevada. Visit www.drinkcoffeedostuff.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A friendly, accessible natural Ethiopia cup, cleanly fruit- and cocoa-toned.

Blind Assessment: Richly aromatic, sweetly tart, deeply savory. Lilac, dark chocolate, lemon drop, pink grapefruit zest, shiitake mushroom in aroma and cup. Harmonious sweet-tart-savory structure; lyrical, syrupy-smooth mouthfeel. The flavor-saturated finish leads with citrus notes (lemon drop, pink grapefruit zest) in the short, rounding to deep chocolate and sweet mushroom notes in the long.
Notes: Guji is nestled next to Ethiopia's better-known Yirgacheffe and Sidamo growing regions. This is a “natural” or dry-processed coffee (dried in the whole fruit). Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.
The Bottom Line: A multi-layered, floral-inclined natural-processed Ethiopia cup with an umami undercurrent: a trifecta of sweet, tart, savory impulses.

Viscous, creamy mouthfeel; resonant, long, flavor-saturated finish. The milk shot is floral, chocolaty and stone fruit-driven in equal measure.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 9 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2021. Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type. GK Coffee is a nano-roastery in Yilan, Taiwan that offers both retail and wholesale coffee. For more information, visit www.gkcoffee.com.tw or email [email protected]

Sweetly savory structure with juicy acidity; crisp, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant finish centers around black currant and hop flowers in the short, cocoa nib and amber in the long.
Notes: This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of “Cause Coffees” for Coffee Review’s March 2021 report. Roasters of these coffees contribute a portion of proceeds to non-profit organizations doing work to improve the lives of others, locally or globally. Processed by the meticulous Kenya variation on the traditional wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Wild Goose emphasizes its relationship-driven green coffee sourcing, and for every pound of coffee sold it purchases ten pounds of food for a local food bank, with over 750,000 pounds donated to date. Visit www.wildgoosecoffee.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A rich-toned Kenya cup with classic black currant notes and both sweet and savory floral impulses.

Roasters of these coffees contribute a portion of proceeds to non-profit organizations doing work to improve the lives of others, locally or globally. A blend of two coffees: a washed Haiti and a natural-processed Ethiopia. Sales of this coffee benefit Moonshot Academy, a leadership and entrepreneurship accelerator program for high-potential small businesses led by women of Haitian descent. Dávila Kafe was founded by David and Gaïna Dávila to highlight coffees from the underrepresented origins of Haiti and Nicaragua. Visit www.davilakafe.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: An interesting blend of two origins not often combined, Haiti and Ethiopia, netting a pleasing, richly sweet cup.

Blind Assessment: A splendid, uncompromising example of its style, though not for everyone. Fresh humus, perique pipe tobacco, freshly dried prune, musk, raw chocolate in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory structure with low-toned, round acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The sweetly earth-toned finish is long and resonant, with notes of forest floor, pipe tobacco and musk.

Notes: Produced at Daterra Estate entirely from coffee of the Aramosa pre-cultivar, a cross between the Coffea arabica species and the small-beaned Coffea racemosa species from South Africa. This crossbreeding was aimed at combining Racemosa’s low caffeine and drought-resistance with Arabica’s flavor. (Aramosa is a pre-cultivar still under development and study.) Processed by the anaerobic honey method (coffee fruit with skins removed but mucilage intact is subject to reduced oxygen ferment before drying). Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Gently fruit-toned. Raspberry jam, wine barrel, dark chocolate, hazelnut, gardenia in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned with brisk acidity; velvety-smooth mouthfeel. The finish evokes hard berry cider with chocolate and gardenia undertones.
Notes:  Yirgacheffe coffees like this one are largely produced from traditional Ethiopian landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying). The green coffee was subsequently stored in oak barrels used to age red wine for several weeks. San Francisco Bay Coffee is one of five coffee brands produced by the family-owned Rogers Family Company. Visit www.sfbaycoffee.com or call 800-829-1300 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A barrel-fermented Ethiopia cup with a light touch — just a hint of wine cask on the nose and palate — supported by sweet berry, floral and chocolate suggestions.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated at a steeping time of 6 minutes. This beverage is composed of coffee that has essentially been toasted but not roasted. Toasted grain, cocoa nib, hints of raw cashew and limelike citrus in aroma and cup. Sweet, woody/grainy structure with a hint of bitterness but no acidy sensation whatsoever. The mouthfeel is thin and tea-like but silky in texture. Grain and nut fade in the finish, though a woody sweetness lasts.
Notes: The Golden Ratio company aims at selling North America on a coffee produced by steeping plump bags of ground coffee that has essentially been toasted rather than roasted. Instructions accompanying these pouches suggest steeping the pouch 5 to 10 minutes to produce an 8-ounce beverage. We achieved what we considered optimal results (maximum aromatic interest) at around 6 minutes. The pouches also can be brewed at room temperature for a recommended 12 to 18 hours. For more information go to drinkgoldenratio.com.
The Bottom Line: Those who want caffeine and the health benefits of coffee without perceived acidity may value and enjoy this subtle, herbal-tea-like beverage. Think cocoa puffs breakfast cereal without the sugar.

Blind Assessment: Lyrically sweet, luxuriously chocolaty. Chocolate fudge, tamarind, sandalwood, narcissus, a hint of wine barrel in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with vibrant, juicy acidity; plush, creamy mouthfeel. The finish resolves around chocolate fudge and tamarind with undertones of rich sandalwood.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 5 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2021. The coffee earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees from roasters in North American beach and coastal communities for Coffee Review’s April 2021 report. Mocca (also spelled Moka and Mokka) is a rare variety of Arabica that apparently originated in the Reunion Islands as a mutant of the great Bourbon variety. This Mocca was processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). This unusual coffee with its tiny beans and striking cup is available only on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400- and 2,500-foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A decadent, dessert-like cup from the rare Mocca variety of Arabica with a throughline of tropical fruit and a hint of sweet ferment.

Blind Assessment: Balanced, deep-toned, floral. Honeysuckle, apricot, almond butter, dark chocolate, a hint of thyme in aroma and cup. Sweet structure with comfortable, straightforward acidity; plush, viscous mouthfeel. Floral-driven finish with undertones of dark chocolate and almond.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from roasters in North American beach and coastal communities for Coffee Review’s April 2021 report. Produced at Kona Hills Farm entirely of the Typica variety of Arabica and processed by the washed method (fruit skin and flesh are removed from the beans before they are dried). Consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans.  Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Big Island Coffee is an award-winning coffee roaster operated with hands-on passion by Kelleigh Stewart and Brandon von Damitz. Visit www.bigislandcoffeeroasters.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A classic Kona Typica cup produced by a new sustainability-minded farm. And nicely priced for a fine Kona.

Blind Assessment: Delicately sweet, deeply fruit-toned. Goji berry, alyssum, almond brittle, marjoram, sandalwood in aroma and cup. Sweet structure with high-toned acidity; very full, viscous mouthfeel. Finish consolidates to notes of goji berry and almond brittle.
Notes: This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from roasters in North American beach and coastal communities for Coffee Review’s April 2021 report. Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was grown in Kona and processed by the natural method (beans are dried in the whole fruit). Kraig and Leslie Lee have been growing and harvesting traditional Kona Coffee for over 25 years. In 2017 they introduced several distinguished new tree varieties to their 4.7 acre farm. Visit konafarmdirect.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A cleanly fruit-forward Bourbon Pointu cup from Kona supported by rich nut, sweet herb, and aromatic wood notes.

Notes: Produced from trees of largely indigenous landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in southern Ethiopia.

Syrupy-smooth mouthfeel; richly bittersweet finish with notes of dark chocolate and pink grapefruit zest. In three parts milk, nut and dark chocolate notes pleasingly dominate.

Blind Assessment: Bittersweet, cleanly fruit-toned. Dark chocolate, raspberry, pink grapefruit zest, almond butter, lilac in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet structure with brisk acidity; syrupy-smooth mouthfeel. The finish centers around notes of dark chocolate and raspberry.
Notes: The Yirgacheffe region produces distinctive coffees from traditional landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in the area. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. David's Nose Coffee is a specialty coffee roaster based in Taipei, Taiwan whose founder studied agronomy and has a deep interest in crop quality. For more information, visit www.dnose.com.tw.
The Bottom Line: A complex, richly fruit-toned natural-processed Ethiopia cup with distinct dark chocolate notes throughout.

Notes: Produced by Padre José Aguilar Posada of Finca Villa Loyola, entirely of the Caturra variety of Arabica and processed by the carbonic maceration natural method, which involves fermenting whole coffee fruit inside a sealed container that has been flushed with CO2, then drying the coffee still in the whole fruit. Roasted at PT’s Coffee, where the motto is “without the love, it’s just coffee.” Visit www.ptscoffee.com or call 888-678-JAVA for more information.
The Bottom Line: Carbonic maceration may promote this coffee’s balance and quiet complexity: chocolate, citrus, herb, flowers.

Richly bittersweet, balanced structure with elegant, bright acidity; very syrupy, viscous mouthfeel. Resonant, long, flavor-laden finish with appealing complexity.
Notes: Produced by the Meyer Family of Nglia Estate entirely of the SL28 variety of Arabica and processed by the washed method (fruit skin and flesh are removed from the beans before they are dried). Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. Paradise prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A Tanzania produced from trees of the SL28 variety so closely associated with Kenya, and reminiscent of the best Kenyas with its nectar-like sweetness, deep complexity, and a surprising and disarming levity.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Complex, multi-layered, rich-toned. Red plum, dark chocolate, cashew butter, cocoa nib, a hint of rosemary in aroma and small cup.

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Black cherry, cocoa nib, lilac, toffee, sassafras. Sweet-savory structure with juicy acidity; crisp, delicate mouthfeel. The savory-sweet theme continues into the finish with notes of lilac and sassafras. The volume is turned down in milk in exchange for a mellow, toffee-driven vibe.
Notes: The coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2021 tasting report. Dripdash brewed and canned the coffee. The brewing was conducted using a cold brewing method in which ice-chilled water drips through a bed of ground coffee over the course of several hours per batch. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. The coffee, sourced and roasted by Chromatic, is a blend of a natural-processed Brazil, a washed Ethiopia, and a washed Guatemala. Chromatic prides itself in doing everything in-house and meticulously, from printing its attractive bags to modifying equipment to sourcing and roasting its exceptional coffees. Visit www.chromaticcoffee.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: What would obviously be a friendly and inviting blend brewed hot is captured here in cold-coffee form: sweet-tart fruit notes juxtaposed with a cocoa and sweet-savory undercurrent.

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Red currant, toffee, lemon-thyme, magnolia, bergamot. Richly sweet-savory structure with balanced, high-toned acidity; crisp, satiny mouthfeel. The finish consolidates to notes of red currant and toffee. Milk enhances the toffee and bergamot notes beautifully.
Notes: The coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2021 tasting report. Prepared using a Yama cold-drip tower, a painstaking cold brewing method in which ice-chilled water drips slowly through a bed of ground coffee over the course of several hours per batch. The green coffee used is a single-origin Kenya. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. Colläge works with local artists to promote fine arts in its region and values serving its community. This coffee is available for purchase at the Collage store and cafe, 221 South Broad Street, Grove City, Pennsylvania.
The Bottom Line: A complex, multi-layered, richly sweet-savory cold coffee that expresses its classic Kenya roots impeccably.

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Baking chocolate, hazelnut, rose hips, raspberry, cedar. Sweet-toned structure with citrusy acidity; pleasingly dry mouthfeel (think good dry vermouth). Resonant, long, flavor-saturated finish. Milk softens all the dramatic edges of this compelling blend, emphasizing a gentle sweet-tart creaminess.
Notes: The coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2021 tasting report. Prepared by the cold-brew method, which involves prolonged steeping of ground coffee in cold or room-temperature water and subsequent filtering. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. Infused with nitrogen when canned. The green coffee blend used is a natural-processed Ethiopia, a washed-process Ethiopia, and a natural-processed Brazil. Corvus particularly focuses on processing methods and selective harvesting, which results in small, seasonal micro-lots of uniquely sweet, vibrant, and clean flavor profiles. For more information, visit www.corvuscoffee.com.
The Bottom Line: A cleanly fruit-forward Ethiopia-Brazil cold-brewed blend, crisp, sweet, balanced and friendly.

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Dark chocolate fudge, raspberry coulis, molasses, almond butter, redwood. Richly sweet structure with brisk acidity; velvety-smooth mouthfeel. The finish is chocolaty, through and through — in milk, dessert-like, reminiscent of a chocolate-raspberry truffle.
Notes: The coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2021 tasting report. Prepared by steeping coffee overnight in warm water, then filtering and chilling. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. The green coffee used is a blend of two coffees: a washed-process Guatemala and a natural Ethiopia. Founded in 2015, States Coffee is a community-focused coffee and bread company in the Bay Area of California, featuring coffee roasted in-house and artisan-baked goods. Available in-store only.

Blind Assessment: A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Apricot, baking chocolate, freesia, lemon-thyme, fresh-cut cedar. Sweetly tart structure with lively acidity; crisp, satiny mouthfeel. Aromatic cedar-like wood notes frame the gently fruit-toned, chocolaty finish. The milk shot softens the brightness and suggests a candy bar from childhood; perhaps a KitKat?
Notes: The coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2021 tasting report. Brewed in Origin’s brewhouse custom built by Deutsche Beverage Technology. Produced in 600-pound batches using sterile filtered water. The brew steeps for 16-18 hours in the temperature-controlled brewhouse and is then double-filtered. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. Infused with nitrogen when canned. The green coffee used is a blend of washed coffees from Guatemala and Ethiopia. Founded by roaster Heather Brisson-Lutz in 2018, Origin Coffee Roasters highlights the origin of each carefully selected coffee with a roast profile that highlights the specific characteristics of the green.

Blind Assessment: Crisply sweet-tart, bright and juicy. Tamarind, pink grapefruit zest, cocoa nib, freesia, redwood in aroma and cup. Bright, juicy, electric acidity; deep, syrupy-smooth mouthfeel. Sweet, long finish with notes of cocoa nib and pink grapefruit zest.
Notes: Processed by the yellow honey method. With all honey processing methods, some sweet pulp or fruit flesh (“honey”) is allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. In the yellow honey variation, a thin layer of pulp is allowed to dry on the beans, more than with white honey, but less than is the case with red or black honey.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso produced as a “ristretto” 25ml (.85-ounce) shot using a Nespresso capsule espresso brewer with whole milk heated using a conventional steam wand. Rich-toned, floral- and fruit-driven. Jasmine, apricot, almond, baking chocolate, cedar in aroma and small cup. Delicately viscous mouthfeel; crisp finish centered around chocolate and almond notes. The milk shot is boldly pleasing, chocolate-laden and richly floral.
Notes: One of the world’s most celebrated coffees presented in a Nespresso-compatible capsule.

This version is the Coronado 6AD nano-lot, sold exclusively to Difference Coffee; only 1,050 boxes are available. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying). Difference Coffee aims to present only the finest of the world’s coffees as determined by green coffee competitions and other measures of distinction, tactfully roasted and presented in capsules compatible with Nespresso capsule brewing systems.

Notes: Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea Arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and most Yemen coffee is still grown from ancient landrace cultivars of arabica on stone-walled terraces ringing fortress-like mountaintop villages.

Blind Assessment: Sweetly spice-toned. Red currant, tea rose, pink peppercorn, cocoa powder, cedar in aroma and cup. Sweet structure with bright, juicy acidity; crisp, velvety mouthfeel. The quiet finish consolidates to notes of red currant and pink peppercorn.
Notes: Despite grower discontent, unclear government coffee policy and urban encroachment on prime coffee lands, the famed Kenya coffee auction system and its participating cooperatives continue to produce some of the world's most elegant and distinctive coffees. Coffee Please is an artisanal roastery and cafe in Taipei’s Beitou District, famous for proximity to the Yangming Mountain hot springs. Visit www.facebook.com/CoffeepleaseTW for more information.
The Bottom Line: A delicate, brightly sweet Kenya cup with a spice throughline and engaging cocoa notes.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Complex, multilayered, cerebral. Dark chocolate, petrichor, ripe pluot, tiger lily, pink peppercorn in aroma and small cup. Lush, syrupy mouthfeel; crisp, rich-toned finish. Layers of aroma and flavor in three parts milk, from sweet pluot and dark chocolate to spice-toned tiger lily and pink peppercorn in the finish.
Notes: A blend of three coffees — a washed Guatemala, a washed Colombia, and a natural-processed Ethiopia — roasted for espresso. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

Notes: Produced at Acacia Hills Coffee Estate entirely of the Geisha variety of Arabica, and processed by the washed method (fruit skin and flesh are removed from the beans before they are dried).

Notes: Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). Taster’s Coffee is a nano-roaster based in new Taipei City, Taiwan. Visit www.tasterscoffee.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: An intensely aromatic, yet delicate, natural-processed Geisha from Ethiopia: juicy, floral, berry-toned.

Blind Assessment: Very fruit-centric, spicily floral. Watermelon candy, star jasmine, agave syrup, pistachio butter, pink peppercorn in aroma and cup. Brightly sweet-tart with energetic acidity; very full, viscous mouthfeel. Resonant, fruit-focused finish with pistachio undertones.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

Notes: Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type, branded Tano Batak by the exporters, Olam specialty Coffee and produced in the admired Lintong region south of Lake Toba.

Blind Assessment: Delicate, richly aromatic, complex. Tangerine zest, cocoa nib, guava, marjoram, jasmine in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with zesty-bright acidity; silky, vibrant mouthfeel. The finish leads with notes of guava and tangerine zest, rounding to cocoa and marjoram in the long.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive landrace Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums. Visit www.jbccoffeeroasters.com or call 608-256-5282 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A nuanced, multi-layered washed Guji cup with deep aromatics that lean toward citrus and sweet herbs, balanced and deepened by cocoa tones throughout.

Blind Assessment: Fruit-forward, multi-layered. Blueberry, musk, cocoa powder, freesia-like flowers, a hint of rum barrel in aroma and cup. Balanced structure with lively acidity; velvety-smooth mouthfeel. The resonant finish leads with dark berries in the short, while the long is characterized by spice-toned florals and a touch of sweet ferment.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are produced from distinctive indigenous landrace Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

Blind Assessment: Richly sweet, deeply nut-toned. Almond butter, cane sugar, orange zest, date, a hint of magnolia in aroma and cup. Sweet structure with gentle, round acidity; crisp, satiny mouthfeel. The quiet, sweet finish that leads with notes of almond butter and date.
Notes: Produced at Tradicao Peixoto, a Black-owned farm, entirely of the Mundo Novo variety of Arabica, and processed by the traditional Brazilian natural method (beans are dried in the whole fruit). This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. True Coffee is a specialty roaster and cafe in Wisconsin whose motto is, “On a never-ending quest to bring you a great cup of coffee, by staying true to the bean.” Visit www.truecoffeeroasters.com for more information.
The Bottom Line: A pleasingly nut-forward Brazil cup with undertones of citrus zest, cane sugar and dried fruit.

Blind Assessment: Richly fruit-toned with savory undercurrents. Blueberry, molasses, hop flowers, baking chocolate, lemon-thyme in aroma and cup. Appealingly bittersweet structure with gentle, round acidity; crisp, lightly satiny mouthfeel. Berry-toned finish with notes of molasses and lemon-thyme.
Notes: A blend of coffees from Ethiopia (one natural-processed, one washed) and a Kenya.

Blind Assessment: Richly aromatic, deeply sweet. Dark chocolate, blackberry, honeysuckle, fresh-cut oak, lemon balm in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with lively acidity; delicately satiny mouthfeel. Rich chocolate and fresh blackberry notes dominate in a flavor-saturated finish.
Notes: Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean.

This version was produced in Kona and is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit.

Blind Assessment: Citrus- and chocolate-toned. Candied mandarin, dark chocolate, hazelnut butter, wisteria, fresh-cut oak in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with bright, balanced acidity; syrupy-smooth mouthfeel. Crisply sweet, citrusy finish with dark chocolate undertones.

Visit www.nostalgiacoffeeroasters.com for more information.

Blind Assessment: Elegantly fruit-toned, complex, deeply layered. Lychee, macadamia nut, pink grapefruit zest, cocoa nib, plumeria in aroma and cup. Richly sweet-tart structure with bright, juicy acidity; supple, syrupy mouthfeel. The long, nuanced finish retains all of the flavor and aroma notes from the cup and adds a subtle incense-like note suggesting sandalwood.
Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 4 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2021. Produced at Santa Felisa farm entirely of the celebrated Gesha (also spelled Geisha) variety of Arabica. Processed by fermentation in the whole fruit with the addition of wild yeasts to the tank, then dried in the whole fruit, making it, in effect, a fermented natural. Kakalove Cafe is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

Blind Assessment: Deep-toned, richly sweet-savory. Blackberry jam, toffee, lavender, spearmint, fresh-cut cedar in aroma and cup. Vibrantly sweet-savory structure with lilting acidity; lively, viscous mouthfeel. Blackberry and lavender notes lead in the short finish, which rounds toward toffee in the long.

Produced at Acacia Hills Coffee entirely of the celebrated Gesha (also spelled Geisha) variety of Arabica, and processed by the washed method (fruit skin and flesh are removed from the beans before they are dried). This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Chromatic prides itself in doing everything in-house and meticulously, from printing its attractive bags to modifying equipment to sourcing and roasting its exceptional coffees.

The Bottom Line: A beautifully composed Gesha peaberry grown in Tanzania, with brambly berry notes, spice-toned florals, and sweet herb notes throughout.

Notes: Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came.  Processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). VERYTIME is a specialty nano-roaster based in Taoyuan, Taiwan. Visit facebook.com/verytime7 for more information.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Concentrated, sweet-tart-savory. Candycap mushroom, mulberry, sandalwood, almond nougat, ginger blossom in aroma and small cup. Creamy-viscous mouthfeel; intensely sweet-tart finish. In three parts milk, tart fruit and umami notes mingle with nut-toned caramel.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopia landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). Kakalove Cafe is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

Blind Assessment: Gently fruit-toned, lyrically sweet. Nectarine, cherry blossom, almond butter, oregano, honey in aroma and cup. Richly sweet with high-toned acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. Integrated finish that retains all the notes from the aroma and cup.
Notes: Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). Taster’s Coffee is a nano-roaster based in new Taipei City, Taiwan. Visit www.tasterscoffee.com for more information.

Blind Assessment: Crisply spice-toned. Nutmeg, clove, baking chocolate, date, fir in aroma
and cup. Sweetly savory with gentle acidity; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. Wood-framed finish supported by notes of baking spices.
Notes: Produced by Don Luis Campos of Cordillera del Fuego and processed by the “thermic” method, in which beans, with skins removed, are heated with some of the fruit flesh or mucilage still adhering to them. The exposure to heat starts to break down the natural sugars of the mucilage, partially caramelizing them. Battlecreek Roasters, founded in 2019, is a Battle Creek, Michigan specialty coffee roaster that donates a portion of all sales to organizations that provide counseling to victims of human trafficking. For more information, visit www.battlecreek.coffee.

Blind Assessment: Brightly sweet, deeply pungent. Amber, red currant, baking chocolate, violet, cedar in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with brisk acidity; crisp, silky mouthfeel. The finish consolidates around amber and currant notes with crisp chocolate undertones.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Jaunt Coffee Roasters is a San Diego-based roaster and café with an extensive coffee and food menu. Visit www.jauntcoffee.com for more information.

Notes: This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Tanzania is particularly associated with its peaberry grades. Chaos Coffee Co. is based in Bayboro, North Carolina and offers artisan-roasted specialty coffee.

Notes: Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was produced in Kona and is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500-foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.
The Bottom Line: Here a darker roast amplifies the intricate resonance of Hula Daddy’s rare Pointu Laurina, a naturally low-caffeine bean that sacrifices nothing in flavor.

Sweetly tart structure with winey acidity; full, syrupy-smooth mouthfeel. Finish consolidates to notes of hazelnut butter and cocoa nib with undertones of blackberry.

Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with washed coffees.

Blind Assessment: Deeply sweet-savory. Blackberry, hop flowers, sandalwood, cocoa nib, a hint of lemon verbena in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory structure with gentle, round acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. Cocoa-toned sandalwood and blackberry notes characterize the resonant finish.

Notes: Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Cozy House Coffee is a Taiwan-based specialty coffee roaster and an SCA Authorized Trainer (AST). For more information, visit https://shop.cozyhousecoffee.com.

 
The Bottom Line: A rich-toned natural Yirgacheffe cup with an invitingly savory-leaning structure and especially viscous mouthfeel.

Deep and rather bittersweet in structure, with low-toned but vibrant acidity. Lightly syrupy, deeply satiny mouthfeel. Dries out a bit in the finish, but a cocoa-toned sweetness lasts.  
Notes: Processed by the natural method, with the addition of a dry fermentation step at the onset of drying. Mogiana is the most traditional of all Brazil coffee growing regions. CafeTaster is a Taiwan-based specialty roaster and certified SCA training facility. For more information, visit www.facebook.com/cafetaster or email roaster Jerry Huang at [email protected]
The Bottom Line: Delicate cocoa, crisp orange, and a fine, satiny mouthfeel distinguish this quietly original Brazil.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Aromatically intense, sweet-tart-savory. Concord grape, lychee, dark chocolate, aloewood, oregano in aroma and cup. Creamy-smooth mouthfeel; savory, herbaceous, chocolaty finish. In three parts milk, savory notes usurp sweet, with inviting aloewood and oregano notes supported by dark chocolate and lychee undertones.
Notes: Produced by Faysel Abdosh from distinctive traditional Ethiopian landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This lot was processed by the anaerobic natural method, in which fermentation of the whole fruit occurs in a hermetically sealed vessel. Founded in 2013, modcup coffee focuses on fresh roasting and distinctive natural-processed coffees. Visit modcup.com for more information.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Complex, richly tart, sweetly herbaceous. Watermelon candy, sassafras, star jasmine, dark chocolate, hint of eucalyptus in aroma and small cup. Viscous, syrupy mouthfeel; crisp, sweetly herbal finish. In cappuccino format, balanced, bright, deep, juicy and chocolaty.

Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Juicy, richly aromatic, sweetly tart. Dark chocolate, pomegranate, sandalwood, lilac, blood orange zest in aroma and small cup. Syrupy-smooth mouthfeel; long, flavor-saturated finish. High-toned and chocolaty in three parts milk, supported by elegant floral and rich aromatic wood notes.
Notes: Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Felala Coffee Lab is an experimental roastery and coffee shop specializing in nano-lot coffees. Visit https://m.facebook.com/groups/4342401375773135/ for more information.
The Bottom Line: A strikingly composed natural-processed single-origin espresso with high-toned fruit, spicy-sweet florals, deep chocolate notes, and a pleasing herbaceous throughline.

Balanced, sweetly tart structure with vibrant acidity; lively, silky mouthfeel. The long, flavor-laden finish leads with notes of bittersweet citrus and narcissus in the short; cardamom and honey resurface in the long.

Blind Assessment:  Richly aromatic, complex. Star jasmine, cocoa nib, bergamot, apricot, sandalwood in aroma and cup. Delicately bright structure with vibrantly juicy acidity; silky, viscous mouthfeel. Resonant, long flavor-laden finish with notes of star jasmine and cocoa nib supported by apricot undertones.

This is a wash-processed version. Quartet Kaffe is an artisan roastery in Taiwan founded in 2018, dedicated to pursuing coffee performance art and offering unique specialty coffee.

Blind Assessment: Richly and suavely bright, balanced. Milk chocolate, cedar, floral-toned vanilla, raspberry, hazelnut in aroma and cup. Very sweetly and lightly tart with gently bright acidity; satiny mouthfeel. Lightly drying but flavor-saturated finish leading with raspberry and vanilla. 
Notes: Produced by smallholding farmers in Bombe village in the Bensa District of the Sidama (also Sidamo) Zone from selections of indigenous landrace varieties of Arabica native to Ethiopia and processed by the traditional washed method (fruit skin and flesh are removed from the beans before they are dried).

Visit www.facebook.com/MKCoffeeRoasters or e-mail [email protected] for more information.
The Bottom Line: A classically and smoothly bright cup with Ethiopian aromatic intrigue: vanilla-leaning flowers and tart berry, in particular.

Crisply sweet-tart structure with delicately bright acidity; silky-smooth mouthfeel. The tart-leaning finish leads with notes of pomegranate and orange zest, supported by oak and pistachio.
Notes: Produced from trees of the admired botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton.

This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came.  Processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit).

Blind Assessment: Bright, richly sweet, complex. Red currant, jasmine, dark chocolate, tangerine zest, maple syrup in aroma and cup. Sweetly savory structure, with juicy-bright acidity. Crisply silky mouthfeel. The balanced, integrated finish is centered around notes of red currant and dark chocolate, with hints of tangerine zest into the long.
Notes: Produced by smallholding members of the Ndumberi Farmers Cooperative Society and processed at the Ngaita Factory (mill) from trees of the SL28, SL34 and Ruiru 11 varieties of Arabica by the traditional Kenya washed method (fruit skin and flesh are removed from the beans before they are dried). Mostra Coffee is a women-, minority-, veteran-, and immigrant-owned micro-roaster based in north county San Diego. For more information, visit www.mostracoffee.com.
The Bottom Line: A vibrant fruit- and chocolate-driven Kenya with elegant floral notes throughout; especially long, lingering finish.

Blind Assessment: Delicately sweet-tarty, fruity and lively. Baking chocolate, pomegranate, lime zest, cashew butter, oak in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with gently bright, winey acidity; crisp, silky mouthfeel. Baking chocolate and lime zest are central in the finish.
Notes: A blend of Typica, Red Bourbon and Red Catuai varieties of Arabica produced by Miranda Farms and JN Farms, processed using a proprietary method involving wine yeasts. The decaffeinated coffees were processed by Kona Decaf in Holualoa using pressurized carbon dioxide gas rather than chemical solvents to remove about 50% of the total caffeine, making this a “half-caf” coffee rather than a coffee decaffeinated using industrial methods that remove almost all of the caffeine. Paradise prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.
The Bottom Line: A partially decaffeinated coffee of exemplary quality and distinction.
Coffees of three traditional varieties are separately processed using Miguel Meza’s “champagne” method, blended, and subjected to partial decaffeination with no use of solvents. The result is a delightfully fruit-driven, chocolaty, low-caffeine cup.

Blind Assessment: Exceptionally balanced, elegant, resonantly spice-toned. Red currant, butterscotch, hazelnut butter, honeysuckle, sandalwood in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with sweetly tart, vivacious acidity; lively, creamy-smooth mouthfeel. The long, resonant finish carries over all the aromas and flavors of the cup.
Notes: Produced by Arturo Aguirre of El Injerto Farm entirely of the very rare, tiny-beaned Mocca variety of Arabica, and processed by the traditional washed method (fruit skin and flesh are removed from the beans before they are dried). Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.
The Bottom Line: A vivid, lyrical washed Guatemala Mocca with layers of complexity, satisfying depth, and rich, balanced resonance that carries far into the finish — a thoroughly complete cup.

GK Coffee is a nano-roastery in Yilan, Taiwan that offers both retail and wholesale coffee. For more information, visit www.gkcoffee.com.tw or email [email protected]

The Bottom Line: Complex and harmonious, intriguing and enigmatic as it unfolds, this washed Ecuador cup — which took first place in the Cup of Excellence this harvest year — is worth seeking out for its bright, confident aromatics that are born out in the rich, multi-layered cup.

El Gran Cafe is a coffee shop located in the heart of Antigua, Guatemala whose mission is to roast and serve organic-certified coffees produced at its own Finca La Esperanza and Finca El Pintado just outside of town. Featured in El Gran Cafe’s lineup are also coffees from friends and neighbors in the region, along with award-winning and exceptional coffees from other regions of Guatemala. Visit https://El Gran.cafe for more information.

The Bottom Line: A deeply floral, richly chocolaty Guatemala cup complicated by sweet nut and resonant aromatic wood notes.
